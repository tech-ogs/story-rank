  "title": "3 Lakh Rats Killed In 7 Days? No Way, Says Ex-Maharashtra Minister",
  "excerpt": "Senior BJP leader and former Maharashtra minister Eknath Khadse on Thursday demanded an inquiry into the way a contract to kill rats in Mantralaya (the state secretariat) was executed ... \"It means it killed 45,628.57 rats a day. Those 0.57 must be the new-born ones,\" he said, evoking laughter in the House ... The government could have deployed ten cats to do the job instead of hiring a private firm, the former revenue minister said in a lighter vein.",
  "comment": "I have gleefully entered this one. The main topic is of course entertaining; but as one reads thru the article, a question niggles at the back of the mind : what if the real issue here is the  BMC which took 2 years to kill a comparable number of rats ? The only basis on which the hon'ble minister castigates the private company is the BMC's performance, so ..... where's the rat ? <br> the clarification (courtesy VMK) <br> http://indianexpress.com/article/india/red-faced-maharashtra-counters-eknath-khadses-claim-about-rats-5109361/",
