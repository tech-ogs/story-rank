  "title": "Chinese woman crawls through railway security scanner to keep an eye on her handbag",
  "excerpt": "... after being told that she must also send her handbag through the machine, she apparently decides that leaving it unattended is a risk too high to take, so climbs in after it ... Despite the best efforts of the machineâ€™s operators to deter the woman, she travels the full length of the conveyor and emerges, along with assorted items of baggage, at the far end. The highlight of the footage is a sequence of orange-tinted X-ray images of the woman on all fours as she passes through the scanner, with her skeleton on view for all the world to see.",
