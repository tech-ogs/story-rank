Condemning Justice Chandrachud’s remarks, The National Fisherfolk Forum said in a statement that \"the utterance of Honourable Justice is tantamount to disrespecting the total fisher communities\" and that the fishermen community is “pained as he has mentioned their activity in a case which has nothing in common\"",
