  "excerpt": "Bhagwat was speaking at an RSS function in Muzaffarpur, Bihar. He is on a 10-day visit to the state. He ... claimed that the RSS had the capacity to form an army within a few days to fight for the country. \"While the Army would take six to seven months to get ready to fight, the RSS would take only two to three days\", Jansatta quoted him as saying.",
