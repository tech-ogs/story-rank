Congress should use this in their defence. I don’t see Vadra running away either. And there is now way these guys will be convicted before the elections. So these arrests may not hurt the congress that much. On the other hand Cong can also highlight the fact that they arrested their own man Kalmadi and allies Raja, Kanimozhi. So it’s game on..

[2/28/18, 5:13:16 PM] Kavi: <i am a bit faltu right now ;) >
[2/28/18, 5:14:41 PM] Kavi: essentially i am contesting that the letter being discussed is emotional but ... maybe the case it makes is not so strong as the emotions suggest
[2/28/18, 5:20:31 PM] Sridhar Mudan: For Y: The context normally is whrn someone doesn't, get it- say in a office meeting. The way the word 'dumb' is used. They would contemptuously be addressed as a 'retard' Fine in a closed, small community. However when such a word is used in public by a politician or minister or a senator against an opponent, amongst the media audience are people who are tending to or caring for a person with mental retardation who wouldn't find it in good taste. Like I said, i might wince, not like it is end of the world but it does hurt.
[2/28/18, 5:25:23 PM] Kavi: Ok so we examine the analogy

Corruption:cancer ::
Retard-insult : retard-disability 

I can see the broad parallel, but in your case the same word is being used in two senses. In the corruption case, the words are being equated. 

A fine’ish distinction, but yes your point stands. Would
You lobby just as strongly however ?
[2/28/18, 5:32:47 PM] Sridhar Mudan: I wouldn't lobby or fight. But we say things like  "are you blind". we don't intend it as an insult to blind people? So i am ambivalent about this whole business of sensibilities.

Sometimes I think the entrepreneur tries too hard to ‘not hurt’ or to even ‘pleasantly surprise’ and surely ‘save the investors the angst of the dips’
But for me the big message there is that investors should be kept well in loop. They are investors and not old men/women with weak hearts - they can handle the truth.
They will always appreciate the trust and the faith from the entrepreneur side
[3/1/18, 7:50:48 AM] ‪+65 9668 5499‬: The other day one of the BP (Big Pockets) was telling me about his experience with a smart young entrepreneur (the Harvard types 😀) who actually evaporated the equity in the first project..........” and he cane to me and explained.

[3/1/18, 8:09:44 AM] Sachit Jain: Depends if you need a lot of capital. In capital intensive industries like steel and textile, you cannot grow without debt. However it is important to have appropriate levels of debt
[3/1/18, 8:13:38 AM] Rajesh Singh: Debt financing leverages Return on Equity. Of course, debt servicing through upturns and downturns have to be thought through

[3/1/18, 8:31:18 AM] ‪+65 9668 5499‬: ‘Articles of faith’ go beyond financial metrics. And they guide operating DNA of biz groups.
However, the care remains same:
- folks who can misrepresent facts to co-investors, run the risk of conning themselves too.
The discipline here is about reacting risk and capital - irrespective of 
- own
- dad’s
- premji’s

[3/1/18, 8:49:29 AM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: The agreements you 
Sign for debt and the protection and recourse lenders have under law are very different from equity

[3/1/18, 9:01:23 AM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: When a lender sees his money not come back and he sees his Job at risk he could lodge a case for fraud to save his own skin especially in PSU banks. The case will be decided over twenty years. The entrepreneurs life is ruined. Debt is a bad idea
[3/1/18, 9:01:54 AM] ‪+65 9668 5499‬: 👍
[3/1/18, 9:08:03 AM] Kavi: This I agree with. The real issue is risk not scale. Debt is very painful on risky cash flows. On guaranteed revenues (monopolies like telecom, highways) debt is mostly ok assuming integrity of operations and control

[3/1/18, 9:09:13 AM] VMK: Agree. The 2008 financial crisis did him in. Subra himself admitted to financial mismanagement. But looks like (I am not sure though) he also diverted funds from Viswapriya. Most depositors in Viswapriya were retired people investing their retirement funds because they trusted the Tambrahm+ IIT/IIM founder. If Subra played with this money it is bad karma.
[3/1/18, 9:09:42 AM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: I remember twenty five years ago we had taken a small OD limit from a nationalised bank. In the guarantee form that I signed the amount was left blank. I said the amount must be filled and the banker said it has to be left blank. When I insisted on filling it I was told that if I don’t leave it blank then the deal was off. I later learnt that it is standard practice for banks to get blank guarantee forms signed when giving loans
[3/1/18, 9:10:35 AM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: We don’t know what actually happened. We know what the prosecution is putting out to the media.
[3/1/18, 9:18:38 AM] Alok Gupta: I agree with bichoo. Financial cos tend to screw the small entrepreneur in case  of default.  The big guys have money to pay off ,leave the country etc

[3/1/18, 10:44:40 AM] ‪+91 99000 94149‬: I am scared of US . Any one at any time can take out a gun and shoot at you anywhere , in the middle of the road , in schools , parks , theatres , metros , shopping malls offices and where not 
They need to make possession of gun as illegal 
High time they did it
[3/1/18, 10:45:05 AM] Sachit Jain: Thank you sir. And I agree wholeheartedly with Jammy that not for startups. In manufacturing because of low return on capital employed even equity would not be available to finance the whole project. The key is to follow the norms. Most of the companies that got into serious trouble did so because of massive funds diversion because it was the norm to finance your share of the equity through the bank borrowings being diverted. So the debt equity was actually higher than it seemed. Further as promoters got greedier, they also diverted money out for building large scale personal assets. Amongst the top industrial houses there are only a few that have not done this. It was a sad state of affairs and hopefully now coming to an end. Many of the promoters whose companies are now on the brink of going away are actually complaining that what was the norm till yesterday is suddenly not applicable any more so I would put this as a major achievement of this government

[3/1/18, 10:55:15 AM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: People like us who pin our hopes on BJP is for the exact reason what Sachit has mentioned in the last point (one of the reasons) and one of the many achievements of this Govt.. Coming from experience od Sachit, the entrepreneur, MLNs should start crediting this govt.🙂🙂
[3/1/18, 10:57:12 AM] Krs Jamwal: Agree fully on the scamster promoters...
[3/1/18, 11:01:59 AM] Rajesh Singh: 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼

I remember having a discussion with the CFO of a Steel Company who brazenly demanded a parallel accounting system and flexibility in retrospectively changing transactions. They wanted a dashboard of *cash* generated! I was completely taken aback by the demand and walked out of the deal.
[3/1/18, 11:10:06 AM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: If we have to put a no.to this debt:equity ratio, irrespective of the industry, if promoters  ideally stick to 2:1 (age old norm, i guess) then,  Relainces/Tatas/ adanis etc.. would not have been the reality today. So the key is personal integrity & honesty of promoters  while talking risks. There is a thin line between market permitting growth plans and avariciousness.
[3/1/18, 11:11:46 AM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Rajesh 👏👏👏 keep it up. Proud of you.
[3/1/18, 11:16:56 AM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: Well said Sachit! 👍
[3/1/18, 11:19:35 AM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: I don’t know why people like me have to evaluate the performance of a government based on the parameters that are important to you. Why can’t I judge based on the parameters that we important to me. You people make this ( not agreeing  with your assessment ) as some kind of major abnormal behaviour. So let’s agree to evaluate the performance of the government based on parameters  that are important to us.
[3/1/18, 11:21:56 AM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Congrats and heartening to  know. That shows your disciplined thinking and implementation!  Though service industry like yours generally is very less capital intensive, but to have grown this big ( I guess no.1 in many of your business segments) without leveraging the debt.speaks volumes about your character. Respects to you Sir. Sanjeev Bikchandani !
[3/1/18, 11:23:31 AM] Sridhar Mudan: Prasads point is, what if all the development and rooting out of corruption is also accompanied by senseless karni type violence do we want that too?
[3/1/18, 11:24:24 AM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: I agree. Why must we demand acceptance and appreciation from every single person, for something that we appreciate a lot?
[3/1/18, 11:25:44 AM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: Why is someone else's appreciation somehow more of a validation than your own conviction?
[3/1/18, 11:26:48 AM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: Sridhar you are assuming that I am giving full marks to the Govt on development and corruption.  Once again we are not expected to give same marks on the same parameter. Take an example of boxing scoring or gymnastics scoring. Each referee gives different scores to the same performance.
[3/1/18, 11:27:26 AM] ‪+91 98103 60586‬: Great shot Prasad. Agree completely.
[3/1/18, 11:28:00 AM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Prasad, i think it is a self goal !
[3/1/18, 11:29:58 AM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: So be it. I can live with my self goals. I am not looking to score goals against any one.
[3/1/18, 11:36:16 AM] JB Jagdish Bajaj: Last year Warren Buffett in his AGM said that companies that don’t need capital in any form ( cash rich ) were the best bets..
[3/1/18, 11:37:34 AM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: Certainly, You give different marks for different performances... but the parameters have to be/are the same.  Higher for the better performer. In gymnastics, there is an additional variable: 'degree of difficulty'.
[3/1/18, 11:38:57 AM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: When the degree of difficulty is higher for the same routine,  then the parameters are no longer the same.
[3/1/18, 11:40:06 AM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: I suspect you are also introducing an additional variable in judging this Government
[3/1/18, 11:40:11 AM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: I said on the same parameter different judges give different set of scores. It’s never the same figure.
[3/1/18, 11:41:03 AM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: Obviously. Based on the performance... Better or worse translates to more or less score!
[3/1/18, 11:41:44 AM] Sridhar Mudan: Good to see gpcp (garam kopdi cp) here again. 🙂
[3/1/18, 11:41:58 AM] ‪+91 98103 60586‬: We also need to bear in mind that in India 40% of the popular vote in a general election translates into a landslide parliamentary majority. So this desire to see consensus only is inappropriate. If your sentiment is shared by the country, the government will be democratically rewarded by being re elected despite a majority of the popular vote disapproving of it.
[3/1/18, 11:42:06 AM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: Most people like to say: Why do you want to compare NDA with UPA? 😢
[3/1/18, 11:44:15 AM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: People have placed different standards for Modi, which is both unfair and yet, a huge compliment
[3/1/18, 11:45:09 AM] VMK: 👍
[3/1/18, 11:45:15 AM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: I am taking on the unfair part of this evaluation. You cannot compare 2 Governments with different yardsticks
[3/1/18, 11:45:19 AM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: You can’t expect a poor farmer from Ratlam and a Salaried middle class person from Erode and a stock broker from Bandra and a diamond merchant from Surat and a SME guy from Indore to judge the government on same parameter. Each one will have their own set of parameters and like in Ven diagram there will be few in common and weightages will also differ. So this talk of homogeneity is really appropriate in a democracy.
[3/1/18, 11:45:50 AM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: That's just like the 'degree of difficulty' analogy, I talked of.
[3/1/18, 11:46:34 AM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: No, but I expect YOU to evaluate the 2 Governments by the same yardsticks
[3/1/18, 11:47:04 AM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: You compare them with the yard sticks set by themselves.
Arvind Kejriwal is considered a huge disaster because he set different benchmark for himself. Same with Modi.
[3/1/18, 11:48:26 AM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: Haa, so you agree that you have a different yardstick to evaluate Modi. Which means, for everyone else, you are willing to lower the bar of your expectations, and evaluate
[3/1/18, 11:48:38 AM] ‪+65 9668 5499‬: Where has NAMO started shining today.......? 
By making private sector and promoters more answerable and disciplined?
[3/1/18, 11:49:54 AM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: That's like comparing IIMA with FMS and saying IIMA is a laggard because it has failed the high standards that they have set for themselves!!😢
[3/1/18, 11:51:50 AM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: I have work. Bye, for now.b🙏🏽
[3/1/18, 11:51:51 AM] VMK: Valid point. But the intelligent voter goes by the absolute achievement not relative (to the yardstick) while deciding who is better. I am unhappy with Modi for failing to deliver against the high expectations but would not go back to Congress because Modi fell short
[3/1/18, 11:52:01 AM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: I said the yardsticks set by the leaders themselves. If someone says  I will double the farm income in x years you will
judge him by that benchmark. 
No. I chose IIMA because it promised to deliver a remarkably higher standard of education package. And I will judge IIMA by what it promised to me.
[3/1/18, 11:52:43 AM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: Yes, you can criticize, but will you prefer the other option?
[3/1/18, 11:55:50 AM] VMK: I think definitely yes. He needs to do that for the public sector and government too. That takes time.
[3/1/18, 11:56:10 AM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: We are all rigid in oue views so this debate will go on ..Sorry gotta run.
[3/1/18, 11:56:14 AM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: Bye guys.
[3/1/18, 11:56:26 AM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: 👍👍 we are in the same page  but I am happy with Modi's achievement.

[3/1/18, 12:05:33 PM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: Fantastic article on the incredible language that Sanskrit is. ☝
[3/1/18, 12:06:38 PM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: Written NOT by a Bhakt but by a Russian (it appears)!
[3/1/18, 12:13:42 PM] ‪+91 98103 60586‬: Nicely said.
[3/1/18, 12:21:45 PM] Rajesh Singh: Not exactly an insider trade by an individual but the Company buying back its shares. This reduces the floating stock and boosts the EPS and hence the share price of the Company. One of the reasons why Warren B was heavily invested in IBM at one point.
[3/1/18, 12:46:29 PM] JB Jagdish Bajaj: Not insider in the way it’s construed in India. When the company buys its own shares, it’s not necessary that they know what’s value. They simply buy Coz they feel this is the best way to deploy their surplus cash rather than give it away

[3/1/18, 12:51:17 PM] Sachit Jain: I would rate 2:1 as too high a debt equity. It was ok in the licensing regime and with high barriers of protection. When the barriers came down and competition increased, this figure should have been reduced. I favour 1:1. Anything more than that in a normal (non utility)business increases the risk. Further we need to take a look at debt to EBITDA ratio which should be around 3. If your debt equity looks reasonable but EBITDA is low, you will again get into a debt trap. And of course it is great if you are in a business that doesn’t require too much of capital to grow. Sadly I am not in such a business!
[3/1/18, 1:01:22 PM] Nikesh: Debt equity ratios depend upon your business and cash flows. On promoters carrying away cash from business is a frightening and sobering tale that I have seen first hand very very often in the business that I am in. The complicity of the banks and other lending institutions is unbelievably high. If we can shut it down it will truly help non recourse financing or risk financing to develop in this country. Most of the banks only do balance-sheet financing with sufficient margins for promoters to cut and run early enough.

[3/1/18, 1:57:27 PM] JB Jagdish Bajaj: There are 3 meanings of Holi.  
1. HO--LI means jo ho chuki. Beet gayi so baat gayi. So clear ur mind n heart from all the hurt n pain. 
2. HO-LI. Means mein bhagwan ki ho gayi. So place urself in God's hands n free urself from all the worries. 
3. HOLY which means pure. So when you forget all the past and surrender yourself to God you become pure. 

HAPPY HOLI TO ALL OF YOU

[3/2/18, 1:55:25 PM] ‪+91 99000 94149‬: Do medicines really expire or are we taken for a ride?

A family of doctors in England & in Mumbai have been hammering the point that medicines don’t expire

By Richard Altschuler

(Culled from the Internet) 

Does the expiration date on a bottle of  medication mean anything? If a bottle of Tylenol, for example, says something like "Do not use after June 1998," and it is August 2002, should you take the Tylenol? Should you discard it? Can you get hurt if you take it? Will it simply have lost its potency and do you no good?

In other words, are drug manufacturers being honest with us when they put an expiration date on their medications, or is the practice of dating just another drug industry scam, to get us to buy new medications when the old ones that purportedly have "expired" are still perfectly good?

These are the pressing questions I investigated after my mother-in-law recently said to me, "It doesn't mean anything," when I pointed out that the Tylenol she was about to take had "expired" a little over four years ago. I was a bit mocking in my pronouncement -- feeling superior that I had noticed the chemical corpse in her cabinet -- but she was equally adamant in her reply, and is generally very sage about medical issues.

So I gave her a glass of water with the purportedly "dead" drug, of which she took 2 capsules for a pain in the upper back. About half an hour later she reported the pain seemed to have eased a bit. I said, "You could be having a placebo effect," not wanting to simply concede she was right about the drug, and also not actually knowing what I was talking about.

On my return to New York and high-speed Internet connection, I immediately scoured the medical databases and general literature for the answer to my question about drug expiration labelling. And voila, no sooner than I could say "Screwed again by the pharmaceutical industry," I had my answer. Here are the simple facts:

First, the expiration date, required by law in the United States, beginning in 1979, specifies only the date the manufacturer guarantees the full potency and safety of the drug -- it does not mean how long the drug is actually "good" or safe to use.

Second, medical authorities uniformly say it is safe to take drugs past their expiration date -- no matter how "expired" the drugs purportedly are. Except for possibly the rarest of exceptions, you won't get hurt and you certainly won't get killed.

Studies show that expired drugs may lose some of their potency over time, from as little as 5% or less to 50% or more (though usually much less than the latter). Even 10 years after the "expiration date," most drugs have a good deal of their original potency. 

One of the largest studies ever conducted that supports the above points about "expired drug" was done by the US military nearly 18 years ago, according to a feature story inThe Wall Street Journal (March 29, 2000), reported by Laurie P. Cohen.

"The military was sitting on a $1 billion stockpile of drugs and facing the daunting process of destroying and replacing its supply every 2 to 3 years. So it began a testing programme to see if it could extend the life of its inventory. The testing, conducted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), ultimately covered more than 100 drugs, prescription and over-the-counter."

The results showed, about 90% of them were safe and effective even 15 years past their expiration date.

In the light of these results, a former director of the testing programme, Francis Flaherty, said he concluded that expiration dates put on by manufacturers typically have no bearing on whether a drug is usable for longer. Mr. Flaherty noted that a drug maker is required to prove only that a drug is still good on whatever expiration date the company chooses to set. The expiration date doesn't mean, or even suggest, that the drug will stop being effective after that, nor that it will become harmful.

"Manufacturers put expiration dates for marketing, rather than scientific reasons," said Mr. Flaherty, a pharmacist at the FDA until his retirement in 1999. "It's not profitable for them to have products on a shelf for 10 years. They want turnover."

The FDA cautioned there isn't enough evidence from the programme, which is weighted towards drugs used during combat, to conclude most drugs in consumers' medicine cabinets are potent beyond the expiration date. However, Joel Davis, a former FDA expiration-date compliance chief, said that with a handful of exceptions -- notably nitroglycerin, insulin and some liquid antibiotics -- most drugs are probably as durable as those the agency has tested for the military. 

"Most drugs degrade very slowly," he said. "In all likelihood, you can take a product you have at home for many years." Consider aspirin. Bayer AG puts 2-year or 3-year dates on aspirin and says that it should be discarded after that. But Chris Allen, a vice-president at the Bayer unit that makes aspirin, said the dating is "pretty conservative"; when Bayer had tested 4-year-old aspirin, it remained 100% effective, he said. So why doesn't Bayer set a 4-year expiration date? Because the company often changes packaging, and it undertakes "continuous improvement programmes," Mr. Allen said. Each change triggers a need for more expiration-date testing, and testing each time for a 4-year life would be impractical.

Bayer has never tested aspirin beyond 4 years, Mr. Allen said. But Jens Carstensen has.

Dr. Carstensen, professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin's (US) pharmacy school, who wrote what is considered the main text on drug stability, said, "I did a study of different aspirins, and after 5 years, Bayer was still excellent.” Aspirin, if made correctly, is very stable.

Now I think I'll take a swig of the 10-year dead package of Alka Seltzer in my medicine chest to ease the nausea I'm feeling from calculating how many billions of dollars the pharmaceutical industry bilks out of unknowing consumers every year who discard perfectly good drugs and buy new ones because they trust the industry.

[3/2/18, 2:02:29 PM] Rajesh Singh: I can think of one valid  reason on why expiry dates may help in a fast developing field of medicines. There could simply be a new improved version of the same medicine or a better medicine for the same illness. Expiry dates help to phase out older versions
[3/2/18, 2:12:15 PM] VMK: That’s a specious argument. If that’s the intention they only need put a message ‘ newer versions of this drug may be available’ on the packaging
[3/2/18, 2:13:14 PM] Rajesh Singh: Even on the latest one?
[3/2/18, 2:14:46 PM] VMK: ‘May be available’ implies that you need to check.
[3/2/18, 2:18:11 PM] Rajesh Singh: Won't that lead to a situation where all versions of a drug will say 'Newer version may be available' and the confused consumer will have to go by the dt. of mfg. This automatically implies that older versions have 'expired'
[3/2/18, 2:25:38 PM] VMK: The pharmacist can always confirm if that is the latest version.
[3/2/18, 2:26:18 PM] VMK: ‘Ask your pharmacist if a newer version is available’?
[3/2/18, 2:27:50 PM] ‪+91 99204 16330‬: Putting expiry dates depends on stringent tests to ensure the drug does not lose its potency. The entire argument that drug makers reduce expiry dates to sell more is not valid atleast in the indian context. All chemists actually return the stocks to the companies . So the drug companies actually try to increase shelf life as much as possible. Unfortunately in pharmaceuticals you cannot sell a drug that is 90 % potent. If it degrades even 1 %, then the shelf life is over. As for newer versions not sure what that means , there may be newer molecules, different drugs. Shelf life is defined by how long the drug retains its potency.
[3/2/18, 2:28:50 PM] Vasu: This is an old Harvard Uni guidance I could see. Echoes Anandh's view above
[3/2/18, 2:28:56 PM] Vasu: https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/drug-expiration-dates-do-they-mean-anything
[3/2/18, 2:31:09 PM] VMK: Could they then publish age VS expected potency charts, so consumers can make informed decisions on using or throwing them?
[3/2/18, 2:34:46 PM] ‪+91 99204 16330‬: Using medicines beyond expiry should ideally not even be required in pure prescription drugs where you just buy as per prescription duration. Expiries atleast from chemists are less than 1-2 %. In patients it may be even lesser unless it is for otc or 
Sos drugs.

[3/2/18, 3:23:26 PM] Vinay Kumar Iima: Don't under estimate the power of a common man - SRK in Chennai Express.
[3/2/18, 3:23:51 PM] ‪+91 99204 16330‬: Agree. But if he can get together educated youth ,not fanatically aligned to the kazhagams, can be a potent force. For that , he needs to come out with a genuine agenda for change rather than just spout generalities. Let's see.

Receiving Donations from Christian missionaries abroad and is actively involved in the spreading of Christianity . I don’t know if he has converted but his brother Charuhaasan has converted to Christianity . 
A hooligan who always try to create one controversy or the other by speaking rubbish on Hinduism and Hindu Gods 
Cannot speak one short sentence neatly . In fact all his sentences are never ending , though he is a versatile actor .
[3/2/18, 3:54:18 PM] ‪+91 99000 94149‬: I don’t know how many votes he can garner but my grapevine is that the Dalit Christians and Dalit who are very large in number in TamilNadu  will be supporting him . 
Forward castes will avoid him like plague , all of devar, Gounder, Vellalar, Pillai , Mudaliar and Brahmins. 
It remains to be seen as to where Muslims will go . Traditionally in TamilNadu Muslims voted for DMK
[3/2/18, 3:59:39 PM] Vinay Kumar Iima: Looks like he is new age Periyar.
[3/2/18, 4:02:55 PM] VMK: Agree. He has the same double standards when it comes to Hinduism vs other beliefs.
[3/2/18, 4:06:26 PM] Sridhar Mudan: He does have issues with his identity. Under a good director with a good script he can be brilliant other wise his manner of talking is very convoluted
[3/2/18, 4:08:22 PM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: He is an Iyengar Brahmin!
[3/2/18, 4:09:43 PM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: Kamal Hassan is a quintessential wannabe intellectual.  He is also a very vulgar man.

Whoof 
Shameful some of his behaviour and utterances are
[3/2/18, 4:11:29 PM] Vinay Kumar Iima: Periyar wanted real reform which can start only if the community reforms itself. Finding fault in others is for status quoists who say I will not change until others do.
[3/2/18, 4:14:29 PM] Vinay Kumar Iima: Shameful sense of caste superiority.
[3/2/18, 4:16:39 PM] VMK: Here is a sample of how he communicates. At the launch ceremony of his party in Madurai recently he roared to the crowd (my translation in to English) “in the political cookery we are about to undertake, this (event) is one morsel of food”. The crowd went silent. I was wondering whether he started a party or a restaurant.
[3/2/18, 4:53:19 PM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: He is too much of an intellectual to succeed. AK succeeded in a city state difficult in a large state. Rajni has a better chance to gobble up aidmk.

Anticonvulsants - narrow therapeutic index
Dilantin, phenobarbital - very quickly lose potency
Nitroglycerin - very quickly lose potency
Warfarin - narrow therapeutic index
Procan SR (sustained release procainamide) - powerful antiarrhythmic agent
Theophylline - very quickly lose potency
Digoxin - narrow therapeutic index
Thyroid hormone preparations
Paraldehyde
Oral contraceptives
Epinephrine - very quickly lose potency
Insulin - very quickly lose potency
Eye drops - eyes are particularly sensitive to any bacteria that might grow in a solution once a preservative degrades.

[3/3/18, 10:45:40 AM] Ashok Venkatramani: One of the most disturbing stories that we find in the Puranas is the story of Krishna's son Samba, whose mother was the bear-princess, Jambavati.

He dupes his father's junior wives by disguising himself as Krishna and is cursed by Krishna that he will suffer from a skin disease that will enable his wives to distinguish father and son. Samba is cured after he builds temples to the sun. All sun temples in India, from Konark in Odisha to Modhera in Gujarat to Markand in Kashmir, are attributed to this son of Krishna.
 
Samba also attempts to kidnap Duryodhana's daughter and this leads to war between the Kauravas and the Yadavas. Peace is restored, and the marriage is solemnised, only after Balarama, Krishna's elder brother, and Samba's uncle, in a fit of fury threatens to drag Hastinapur into the sea. 

Then there is the story of Samba pretending to be a pregnant woman and duping sages who were visiting Dwaraka. They sages were not amused and cursed Samba that he would give birth to an iron mace that would be responsible for the end of the Yadu clan. 

Must not Krishna's son be as noble and divine and wise and loving as Krishna? But that is not so. Samba comes with his own personality and his own destiny over which Krishna has no influence. Or does he? 

Can we wonder if Samba was a product of his father's neglect? For was not Krishna spending most of his time with Arjuna and the Pandavas and in the politics of Kuru-kshetra?
 
There are hardly any stories of Krishna as father. He is friend, philosopher and guide to Arjuna, but the only stories of father and son are of tension, rage and violence. 

In conversations about corporates, we often forget about the other half of our lives, the personal one. As more and more people are working 24x7, thanks to Internet, and smart devices, the lines between professional and personal, work and life are getting blurred. In fact, people feel noble when they sacrifice family for work and guilty when they take a holiday to take care of their family. 

Family is not seen as achievement. Children are not seen as purpose. They are seen as obligations, duties, by-products of existence, even collateral damage.  

We admire leaders who sacrifice family for a 'larger' cause. Like freedom fighters who neglect their wives and children. Like business men and entrepreneurs and consultants who spend most of their time in office.

With the rise of feminism, women are also working. Parenting has been outsourced to maids, teachers, computers, videogames and grandparents.

Women who work in the office have not been compensated by their husbands spending more time at home. Instead women are made to feel guilty for not being good mothers. No one questions men for not being good fathers. Eventually, the office wins. Absent parents rationalise how office is more important than the children: we need the money, the children eventually grow up, surely our needs are also important. 

Many great Krishnas in the workplace discover that they have nurtured Samba at home: sons who either follow destructive paths as they seek attention, or sons who make their way away from parents, as they have grown used to not having them around. Who wins?

Corporates were supposed to create wealth for the family. Now families are creating only workers for the corporates. 

We have many more Krishnas in this generation and maybe many Sambas in the next.

But  also be aware of mounting criticism of his works by other Sanskrit/ Indology experts like Rajeev Malhotra and Nityanand Misra. They point out glaring misinterpretations of the Puranas and mischievous casteistic aspersions in Devdutt’s books. They also think Devdutt does not know Sanskrit and gives his own meanings / interpretations to words. Devdutt has till now not responded to very specific comments on his works made by the two, but chooses to attack them personally for their NRI status - calls them Bharat Mata Tyagis just because they have given up Indian passports.

In astrology , the 22nd Drekkana (one Drekkana is one third equal part of a sign ) 
Determines how death occurs 
This is the first Drekkana of the 8 th House . By carefully analysing the 22nd Drekkana one can predict the mode of death , given an Horoscope , for e.g. fall from an animal , attack by an animal , injection of poison , natural causes etc 
Very unfortunate that this gentleman had to die a gory death

[3/4/18, 11:31:08 AM] Rajesh Singh: Bajji try this

3. Old Monk can shatter myths related to summer drinking. Many think rum is not for summer. They are wrong. As wrong as the sun rising in the West. All you need to do is fix yourself the right drink. Take 60ml Old Monk, add one tablespoon of honey to it, and another of lemon juice. Throw in four-five mint leaves. Mix them properly. Fill a glass with crushed ice, pour the rich mix into the glass. Your drink is ready.

Visa to Pakistan was only
For Lahore. And within Lahore I was not
Allowed to visit Defence. Of
Course to go to the airport you have to go through defence

Their visas and went

[3/4/18, 12:54:49 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: I did not
[3/4/18, 12:57:11 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: In fact I was advised to stay in the hotel and go out only
With our hosts. I was specifically advised not to catch taxis because if
The driver found out who I was or even the fact that he picked me up from the Pearl Continental there was a chance that he might sell me
To a gang who would abduct me for ransom
[3/4/18, 12:57:59 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: So I entertained Pakistani guests in my room and ordered alchohol room service

```Hello!  Is this Gordon's Pizza?

No sir, it's Google's Pizza.

Did I dial the wrong number?

No sir, Google bought the pizza store.

Oh, alright - then I’d like to place an order please.

Okay sir, do you want the usual?

The usual?  You know what my usual is?

According to the caller ID, the last 15 times you’ve ordered a 12-slice with double-cheese, sausage, and thick crust.

Okay - that’s what I want this time too.

May I suggest that this time you order an 8-slice with ricotta, arugula, and tomato instead?

No, I hate vegetables.

But your cholesterol is not good.

How do you know?

Through the subscribers guide.  We have the results of your blood tests for the last 7 years.

Maybe so, but I don’t want the pizza you suggest – I already take medicine for high cholesterol.

But you haven’t taken the  medicine regularly. 4 months ago you purchased from Drugsale Network a box of only 30 tablets.

I bought more from another drugstore.

It's not showing on your credit card sir.

I paid in cash.

But according to your bank statement you did not withdraw that much cash.

I have another source of cash.

This is not showing on your last tax form, unless you got it from an undeclared income source.

To HELL With Ur Pizza..!!
ENOUGH!!
I'm sick of Google, Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp. I'm going to an island without internet, where there’s no cellphone line, and no one to spy on me ...

[3/4/18, 1:46:11 PM] Arvind Sahay: A response from the CTO of a leading security firm based in Silicon Valley on this. The question was on authenticating the videos. 

I was with Chief Security heads of 12 banks - banks use social security number, date of birth, mothers maiden name etc to validate a person. All that has now been stolen so well funded hackers get past them.

So we have been using voice recognition to authenticate users. Given voice patterns are unique.

So now in US, you get blank calls. You pick up and say hello. That record that..and now generate your information in your voice.

At this moment the full personal info of all Americans with voice patterns etc is now for sale.

India is worse- Aadhar got hacked and all your biometric info plus personal info is stolen.
[3/4/18, 2:03:25 PM] Rajesh Singh: Too good!!
[3/4/18, 2:08:23 PM] Kavi: this lament is about authentication of a person who (say) presents a transaction to be executed

goki's question was on non repudiation of a video clip (this video clip has not been tampered with)

arguably, the video-non-repudiation problem is different, and perhaps easier than the first.
[3/4/18, 2:15:50 PM] VMK: I don’t think the biometric info is stolen (yet). Rest of the info has been in public domain even before Aadhar was introduced.

[3/4/18, 2:53:36 PM] JB Jagdish Bajaj: A Professor started his class on a very serious Topic. The moment he turned towards the blackboard, one of the students whistled. He turned, looked at the class and asked the Whistler's name. No one answered.

The Professor peacefully kept the Pen in his pocket saying: "Lecture ends here. I'll tell you a story to utilise the remaining time".

 Everyone became interested.

"Yesterday night I tried hard to sleep, but it was miles away from my eyes, so I thought I'd better get petrol in my car, which will save my time next morning and might induce sleep. After having my tank full, I started roaming in that area, enjoying the peace of a traffic free ride. 

Suddenly, on the corner I saw a girl who was as young and beautiful as the clothes she was wearing. Must have been returning from a party. Out of courtesy, I turned my car towards her and asked if I may be of any help. She asked me if I could drop her to her home, she'll be very obliged, to which I agreed.

She sat in the front seat with me. We started talking, and to my amazement she was very intelligent, had control on many topics which many youngsters don't. 

When we reached her address, she admitted my courteous nature and behavior and accepted that she had fallen in love with me. 

I also admitted her intelligence and beauty and that I've also started liking her. I told her about my job as a professor in the university.

The girl asked my number, which I gave her willingly. Then she asked me a favor, to which i couldn't have denied naturally.

She said that her brother is a student in the same university, and asked me to take care of him, since we'll be in a long relationship now.

I asked the name of the student. She said that I'll recognise him with one of his very prominent quality, *He whistles a lot!*

All eyes in the classroom turned towards the boy who had whistled.

The professor said:  *"I didn't get my Ph. D in Psychology by sitting on my _ _ _!!"

1. Legalized gay marriage

2. Legalized marijuana

[3/4/18, 6:24:38 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: It was probably filled earlier but not by a Hindu woman
[3/4/18, 6:26:40 PM] Kavi: then it was not so reserved, because as I understood the term, a reserved seat can only be voted for by members of the class it is reserved for, and can only have a candidate from that class. The british (according to mr tharoor) invented the concept to polarize India...
[3/4/18, 6:29:36 PM] Nikesh: This is probably because women never had reserved seats till 2010 or 2011.

As per this report she is” first Dalit woman senator “. PPP already elected another Hindu woman as Pak’s first Hindu woman senator “ . So the operative word here is “ Dalit “
[3/4/18, 6:41:11 PM] Nikesh: Hari Ram {not to be confused with Har ram nai from Sholay} represented the Sindh non Muslim seat from 2012 to 2018. She is his successor.

[3/5/18, 11:04:42 AM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: For those of you who are upset with BJP and want to punish Narendra Modi, here is a piece of painful and shameful history. A long, but MUST read.

Sometime in 1994 there was rift brewing in the Congress Party in Kerala. The then Chief Minister K Karunakaran’s son had insulted Ramesh Chennithala, G Karthikeyan and Shahnawaz (all members of the I group faction that  Karunakaran led)

Another Congress Factional leader AK Antony (leader of the A group -  rival faction in Congress) was planning to topple Karunakaran to install himself as the chief minister. His hitman for the Job was Oomen Chandy, the FM in the Karunakaran cabinet

If Antony had to replace, they had to make the formidable Karunakaran fall big time. Karunakaran had the sworn allegiance of the most of the  Police establishment in Kerala, for whom he had a special liking.

One of Karunakaran’s blue-eyed officers was IG Raman Srivastava, an exceptionally talented officer with impeccable integrity. But Raman Srivastava was at the cross-hairs or another officer, DIG Siby Mathews, who was Oomen Chandy's close confidant.

Siby Mathews knew that he could never be DGP if Raman Srivastava remained in the force and was out to sabotage Srivastava. Hence, the plan was to bring down Karunakaran by framing Srivastava. The wolves were looking for the perfect opportunity. Any collateral damage was acceptable to these people to meet their goals 

This is when a Senior Inspector Vijayan came across a strikingly good looking Maldivian woman, Mariyam Rasheedha, who had come to the commissioner office to get her Visa extended. Vijayan wanted “certain favours” from Mariyam and was promptly rebuked. Seemingly she told Vijayan, that i will complain to your IG.

At another level, IB additional director Rattan Sehgal, who was later discharged for being a CIA mole, was looking at sabotaging the Indigenous Cryogenic Engine program of ISRO being worked on at LPSC (Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre) Mahendragiri. 

Rattan Sehgal’s target were the two scientists who were critical to the program, Nambi Narayanan and Shasi Kumar. He let his deputy RB Sreekumar into this conspiracy. Sreekumar was very close to the Antony faction of the Congress establishment in Kerala. He was already part of the discussions of the Antony faction to bring down Karunakaran Govt.

*Does the name RB Sreekumar (RBS) sound familiar? Yes, the  Additional DGP Intelligence of Gujarat during the 2002 riots who made false allegations against Narendra Modi on behalf of the Congress*. 

All pieces of the game were failing together for RBS, Siby and the Antony Faction of the Congress. *They knew this would be at the cost of the lives of two Maldivian women, an honest IPS officer and two top scientist of ISRO who were heading a prestigious program for India*.

India was denied cryogenic technology by the US under MTCR, and even the Russian’s withdrew after pressure from the group. India had to develop its own Cryogenic engine. The task was given to Nambi Narayanan and Shasi Kumar of LPSC. They were the main people behind India's space warhorse PSLV. 

*Hence, each of the conspirators knew if these scientists were removed from the picture, India’s Space and Missile program will suffer a body blow. But for the Antony faction they didn’t care for the nation or its security; they just wanted to take out the rival in the party. For Siby Mathews , it was his promotion which mattered. For Rattan Sehgal its was the dole from CIA which mattered. For RBS, pleasing his Congress bosses mattered. INDIA, the nation mattered to none of them*.

*Thus a grand conspiracy was hatched. A leading Malayalam newspaper was roped in as the chief propagandists. The modes of communication were set. The senior editor suggested that reports should have a mix of sex and sleaze. Writers who could spice up the police versions were pulled into write stories in the publication*.

One fine day Kerala and India woke up to the story of two middle-aged scientist from ISRO who were honey trapped by two Maldivian women, Mariyam Rasheeda and Fawzia Hassan. We were told the two scientists sold India’s cryogenic engine secrets in exchange for sex and millions of dollars!

The National and Malayalam media reported every version *put out by the police*. The leading Malayalam publication , and its commissioned soft porn writers put our stories with vivid details of sexual encounters of the Maldivian women involving the scientist’s and a senior police officer in Kerala.

In few days, stories of the Police officer being close to the CM Karunakaran involved in the Espionage was covered in the media. Thus hinting that the CM is shielding the officer and hence personally involved in the ISRO Espionage scandal.

The media starts insinuating IG Raman Srivastava as the officer involved and targeted Karunakaran for supporting him. *It was clear to every one involved that Srivastava did not even have a remote involvement with any of this. But the Antony cabal had planned this route to get to the jugular of Karunakaran*. 

The prominent Malayalam media  house pumped in more colourful stories. The HC took cognisance of the reports and passed strong strictures against the government for not getting IG Srivastava investigated. Oomen Chandy, who was the then FM, resigned from the ministry to pressure Karunakaran.

Finally, Karunakaran relented and resigned as the CM. 'Saint' Antony took over as the the CM of Kerala. The Antony cronies at Kerala Police knew that they had no case and they would be castigated by the courts when they present evidence. Hence, DIG Siby Mathews recommended   transfer of the case to CBI.

Meanwhile, the two Scientists Nambi Narayanan and Shashi Kumar underwent painful torture at the hands of the Kerala Police and at the hands of IB led by RBS. *They were forced to confess a crime which did not exist. The two Maldivian Women were sexually exploited. The families of the two scientist were branded spies and harassed. Nambi Narayanan's wife was once asked to get out of an autorickshaw because she was married to a spy. Even his children were targeted and  branded aa traitors*.

*The CBI formed a special team to investigate this high profile case. In the very first week of investigation it was found out that there was not even a shred of evidence against the accused. Forget evidence, the very basis of the case did not exist; there was no “Espionage”*

*Yet the leading Malayalam publication created fake stories of how the CBI had admitted to finding large amounts of hidden assets found from the homes of the two scientists*. The Media house couldn’t let down the Antony ministry in its early days. If there was no spy case, then the very basis of leadership change would collapse.

*Finally, the CBI admitted in court that it was well-planned conspiracy by the Kerala Police and there was no case against the accused. It recommended action against KP officers, Siby Mathews , Vijayan, KK Joshua and IB officer RBS*.

*The Supreme Court of India discharged all the accused and ask the Government to take action against the Police and IB officers*. Subsequent governments didn’t act on the SC directions. Siby Mathews was rewarded with the Chief Information Commissioner post by Oomen Chandy when he became CM.

*The IB additional director Rattan Sehgal was later caught passing on India’s atomic secrets to CIA and was discharged from service. He fled to the USA*. 

RBS made a career out of Modi abuse and can still be seen on anti-Modi seminars alongside Teesta Setalvad and the rest Break India farces.

Antony went on to become India's Defence minister who single handedly led the decay in the infrastructure and preparedness of our Armed Forces.

The two unfortunate scientists were never rehabilitated, even after they were discharged by courts. They were given desk jobs, and lived with the tag of traitors. 

*The biggest victim of this conspiracy was national security and our space program. The cryogenic engine program was setback by two decades and only in 2017 we were able to do a full system flight with this technology.*

*Congress Crooks played with lives of our Scientists, Space program, helped the CIA, and compromised national security to win a petty inner party factional fight*.

This is the “Congress Mindset” that Narendra Modi keeps mentioning. They will eat this country hollow and not bother as long as their petty agendas and that of the Gandhi family is taken care off.

[3/5/18, 12:01:42 PM] Sridhar Mudan: Broadly speaking When people come together under any umbrella, based on religion, caste or brliefs their strength is leveraged by a sub population within to corner resources and compete. So any kind of group identity, be it geography based (nations), religion based ( hindu, muslims, Christianity..) or profession based (traders, financiers) or species (man versus animals) also sets up contingencies for   cornering resources based on the identity and also sets up forces that are inimical to its identity. So it is not surprising that  there are wars since times immemorial and there will wars and strife well into the indefinite future. The best one can hope is that there may be some unifying factors across such group identities that temporarily atleast keep warring interests under check

*When Hitler invaded Poland & started the World War II, 500 Polish women & 200 children were put on a ship to save them from the Germans. The ship was left in the sea by the Polish Army and the Captain was told to take them to any country where they can get shelter.  The last msg from their countrymen was "If we are alive or survive, we will meet again!"*

 *The ship, filled with 500 refugee Polish women & 200 children were refused to come in by many European Ports, Asian Ports like Seychelles, Aden etc.  The ship continued to sail & somehow reached a harbour port of Iran. Yes so far away! There also they did not get any permission!*

*Finally, the ship wandering in the sea reached India and came to then port of Bombay. The British Governor also refused the ship to port!*

 *Where the Maharaja of Jamnagar, "Jam Saheb Digvijay Singh" came to know  about this ship, he became truly concerned!*

*He allowed the ship to port in his kingdom at a port near Jamnagar! He not only gave shelter to 500 women but also gave their children free education in Balachiri in an Army School!*

*These refugees stayed in Jamnagar for nine years, till World War II lasted. They were well taken care of by Jam Saheb who regularly visited them and was fondly called Bapu by them!*

*Later these refugees returned to their own country.  One of the children of these refugees later became the Prime Minister of Poland.  Even today, the descendants of those refugees come to Jamnagar every year & remember their ancestors!*

*In Poland, the name of many roads in the capital of Warsaw are named after Maharaja Jam Saheb.  There are many schemes in Poland in his name. Every year Poland newspapers print articles about Maharaja Jam Saheb Digvijay Singh!*

*From the ancient times, the msg of India वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम (the world is a family) & its tolerance has been wellknown in the world. A few people today raise doubt & put question marks on India's tolerance. India was will remain with Indian Culture - Rich ,brave, tolerant, compassionate & genuinely humanitarian - plus pro life, pro good values & great respect!*

*This was an illustrious page from modern contemporary history, little known to many today even in India!*

*Thought that you might want to know!*

[3/5/18, 2:49:10 PM] ‪+91 98408 56130‬: S. Kumar, Vishy and I Just came out from Anil's place. It was very tough. Anil Kumar was fairly composed.
[3/5/18, 2:49:59 PM] Vasu: Actually a doctor friend said this is not an impossible situation. Thee following is quoting her verbatim....
[3/5/18, 2:50:14 PM] Vasu: Because he died in his usual office position and the rigormortis set in, he was frozen in his normal position.Do people did not suspect. Other conditions like humidity temperature environment etc influence the decay rate. It doesnt set in that early especially in winters.
[3/5/18, 3:04:33 PM] Kavi: ask your doctor about the loss of sphincter muscles and the sudden release of urine and feces, perhaps the employee obligingly went to the bathroom just before dying ...
[3/5/18, 3:06:02 PM] ‪+91 99000 94149‬: Kavi you are medically absolutely right
[3/5/18, 3:07:08 PM] ‪+91 99000 94149‬: A coronary event like that resulting in death would have triggered the loss of sphincter muscles before death actually took place
[3/5/18, 3:07:53 PM] ‪+91 88607 00028‬: Terrible, really bad news. May the almighty give Anil and his son the strength to overcome this great loss.
[3/5/18, 3:13:42 PM] Vasu: She says that is not the case in normal deaths
[3/5/18, 3:15:02 PM] ‪+91 88607 00028‬: <‎audio omitted>
[3/5/18, 3:24:40 PM] Kavi: random google search brings up a nurse's response :

http://allnurses.com/general-nursing-discussion/body-fluids-and-286300.html?PageSpeed=noscript

conclusion : if "normal" death means the ICU then perhaps your doctor is right. If it means a person dying on their worktable while active, they are probably wrong
[3/5/18, 3:25:06 PM] Kavi: i can't believe we are discussing this crap (literally!) :)
[3/5/18, 3:31:48 PM] ‪+91 95940 31317‬: Vishy please convey our condolences to Anil. Very very sad news.

[3/5/18, 9:18:07 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: While i am also of the opinion that it is a title suit the closing of which would solve the issue, the moot point Is,   what and where and when is the beginning of the title?  Can it be really traced to 100s/1000s of years ago?  How authentically any party would prove their case ? If viewed that every single place where mosque  existed was originally a place belonged to a Hindu and every body wants to retrieve their lost land quoting this verdict, where it will stop?
[3/5/18, 9:21:21 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: BJP should focus only on development agenda !
[3/5/18, 9:22:03 PM] ‪+1 (647) 241‑7185‬: So sad to hear the news of Anil’s wife ‘s demise. Chandra / Vishy lets know what we can do . Wd like to visit when I am there. prayers for the family .
[3/5/18, 9:27:27 PM] ‪+91 94267 00946‬: I have been sad since morning. I never met Anil's family. Yet I am sad
 
I have lost friends prematurely. And been part of funeral processions for thier parents. But perhaps for me the first case of a friend's wife going early.

And then the question if this happens to me? How dependent am I on my wife. Emotionally, physically, logistics wise etc etc. No end. 

All the messages on WhatsApp and everywhere else about spouse being most important person suddenly sinking in with a whole new meaning. And it makes me sad.
[3/5/18, 9:45:19 PM] VMK: That’s exactly why an out of court settlement makes sense.
[3/5/18, 9:52:47 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Who will abide by the out of court settlement?  There is moral obligation nor legal compulsions.  In my opinion, BJP should forget this Ram Mandir issue keep the land as ' no operation' zone. I don't think people will really mind that if growth and development happens for every body.
[3/5/18, 9:54:57 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Actually a title suit is covered by the statute of
Limitations and by that logic the Hindus don’t have a claim
[3/5/18, 9:56:56 PM] ‪+91 94267 00946‬: My feedback..

Muslims are willing to give up the land. Many believe that since there has been idol worship at the spot it is no longer fit to be a mosque.

They want assurance on other disputed structures. There are 8-9 more such disputed structures. Call them mosque or temple. 

Muslims worry about the chant "Ayodhya to jhanki hai, Kashi Mathura Baki hai".
[3/5/18, 9:58:06 PM] ‪+91 94267 00946‬: Those who have been to Krishna Janam Bhoomi at Mathura will know exactly what I refer to
[3/5/18, 10:00:36 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: While on this but on a separate note, i am of the view that Hindu way of life/ history (as opposed to Hinduism as religion) should be known to people and should be advocated. For any nation, history is very important in order to have a strong nationalist fervour  which will pave the way for many good things.
[3/5/18, 10:01:29 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: * read as.. 'no moral obligation nor.. ..'

[3/5/18, 10:16:46 PM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: 1 lakh cr extra direct tax due to demo n just 20% can cover hosp insurancefor bottom 40%. Also corrected real estate price n in next decade reduce rent multiple for owning a house to half of pre demo.
[3/5/18, 10:17:50 PM] ‪+91 94267 00946‬: Yes. Total 8-9 such issues
[3/5/18, 10:19:01 PM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: 1 lac cr looks not major just 13% of direct tax or 7% of total tax but given most cost being fixed in nature huge % of discretionary for new initiatives.
[3/5/18, 10:20:04 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: I think govt tax collection should not be the only
Prism to evaluate this from. One should also look at loss of growth and livelihoods

[3/5/18, 10:28:23 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: You are wading into our territory. Or are you swinging both ways ?
[3/5/18, 10:36:36 PM] VMK: Agree
[3/5/18, 10:42:39 PM] VMK: The actual list across the country may run in to thousands of temples. Qutb complex in Delhi was supposed to have housed 28 temples. But you can’t mindlessly try to erase or reverse history. Muslims conceding Ayodhya with an assurance that everything else will be left as they are may be the right way to go. But how will you make this binding on anyone?

[3/5/18, 11:12:36 PM] Nikesh: This is Lenin. Not exactly relevant to Tripura right?
[3/5/18, 11:26:46 PM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): Perfectly normal to feel like that. When my wife had a serious health scare I was traumatised too. All better now. All the best.
[3/5/18, 11:34:56 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Not very smart. This kind of
Triumphalism will create a backlash sooner rather than later

[3/5/18, 11:46:04 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: Was it part of their manifesto or election promises? What message are they sending? This shows only destructive / intolerant mind set. Next will they invade and destroy Sri Lanka?
[3/5/18, 11:50:31 PM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): I use the ESTA route. Gets instant visa.
[3/5/18, 11:51:30 PM] Vasu: That state has been under communist rule for some 25 years. It is a bit presumptuous of us to think we know what suffering they have been through. Going by experience elsewhere oppression is a hallmark of communist goovernemnts
[3/5/18, 11:55:28 PM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: It is regime change after 25 years. CPM deploys domination n when it changes its nothing short of revolution.
[3/6/18, 12:01:01 AM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: It is a democracy
[3/6/18, 12:06:32 AM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: Are you serious about supporting such destructive behaviour in a democracy. They just used their democratic tool to throw out the communists. So where is the need for this kind of destruction.
[3/6/18, 12:09:02 AM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: These are simple victory celebration. Rather than dumping him in govt store straight up they need to pick fm ground n dump. This lets off steam n reduces post poll violence.
[3/6/18, 12:15:59 AM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: Great! Let’s encourage people to celebrate by demolishing Tejomahal, Fatehpur Sikri, Qutubminar, Charminar, Red Fort.. it will calm / distress so many more people and avoid violence..

Thanks for sharing Arnab
[3/6/18, 6:04:21 AM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Slightly different version from someone who was involved in the case. Arnab’s forward seems to be BJP propaganda against the Congress

[3/6/18, 9:21:42 PM] Alok Gupta: 👍👍
Anyone who enjoyed George Carlin will enjoy this!  English language isn't the easiest language to figure out. 
 
 
The English Plural
According to....

We'll begin with a box, and the plural is boxes,
But the plural of ox becomes oxen, not oxes.
One fowl is a goose, but two are called geese,
Yet the plural of moose should never be meese.
You may find a lone mouse or a nest full of mice,
Yet the plural of house is houses, not hice.

If the plural of man is always called men,
Why shouldn't the plural of pan be called pen?
If I speak of my foot and show you my feet,
And I give you a boot, would a pair be called beet?
If one is a tooth and a whole set are teeth,
Why shouldn't the plural of booth be called beeth?

Then one may be that, and three would be those,
Yet hat in the plural would never be hose,
And the plural of cat is cats, not cose.
We speak of a brother and also of brethren,
But though we say mother, we never say methren.
Then the masculine pronouns are he, his and him,
But imagine the feminine: she, shis and shim!

Let's face it - English is a crazy language. 
There is no egg in eggplant nor ham in hamburger; 
Neither apple nor pine in pineapple. 
English muffins weren't invented in England.

We take English  for granted, but if we explore its paradoxes,
We find that quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square, 
And a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig.
And why is it that writers write, but fingers don't fing, 
Grocers don't groce and hammers don't ham?

Doesn't it seem crazy that you can make amends but not one amend?
If you have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of all but one of them,
What do you call it?

If teachers taught, why didn't preachers praught? 
If a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat?

Sometimes I think all the folks who grew up speakingEnglish
Should be committed to an asylum for the verbally insane.
In what other language do people recite at a play and play at a recital?

We ship by truck but send cargo by ship...
We have noses that run and feet that smell.
We park in a driveway and drive in a parkway.
And how can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same,
While a wise man and a wise guy are opposites?
 
You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language
In which your house can burn up as it burns down,
In which you fill in a form by filling it out,
And in which an alarm goes off by going on.
 
And in closing..........

If Father is Pop, how come Mother's not Mop????

[3/7/18, 7:35:52 AM] Shumone: <‎image omitted>
[3/7/18, 7:36:59 AM] VMK: I think the article is totally biased. I see no harm in research centred around the Puranas to see if there is evidence to convince people that they are part of our history not just mythology, as long as the conclusions drawn are evidence based. Same with trying to resurrect important scientific knowledge buried in Vedic scripts that would otherwise be lost forever. 
The Aryan invasion theory cleverly advanced by Max Muller is already widely debunked by the scientific community. In that sense there is nothing wrong in accepting that all Indians have  a Hindu ancestry. Denying this is no different from Hindutva bigots trying to erase all symbols of Islamic rule from our memories / history books.

We have not come from some unknown land to recite Vedas now also which have been passed on to the generations only by word of mouth 
Max mueller got it all wrong and wanted the European society to take credit for the great tradition of the Sanathana Dharma practitioners in the subcontinent by stupidly propounding a theory that Aryans migrated to The subcontinent roughly 5000 years ago . 
Every discovery thereafter with the DNA technology refuted that bogus claim

[3/7/18, 10:08:24 AM] VMK: That’s not right. He was the first petitioner against Jayalalithaa and Sasikala, with Sasikala ending up in jail. In NH case he has gotten Sonia / RaGa strongly implicated and they are currently on bail. Swamy is the only guy who takes his allegations to their logical end through court cases. Also there is not a single charge of corruption or blackmail against him in all these years of his anti corruption efforts. Show me one.

[3/7/18, 10:42:34 AM] VMK: Great story. Swamy is a maverick who cannot be controlled by anyone. He will therefore possibly never make it to a minister in Modi’s govt. His Hindutva utterances could also be aggressive or even extreme that would make many uncomfortable. But when it comes to fighting corruption no one like him. And I did not see anything in the story to say that he blackmails to make money.

[3/8/18, 9:24:26 AM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: Hindus find themselves stuck in a strange place, still reeling under the effects of colonialism, reprimanded for being too backward and pulled towards a future we did not invest in. 

Our time was not a straight arrow leading to the unencumbered domination of the planet but we live through the horrors of kaliyuga, participating in a global economy that is designed to destroy the earth. 

We didn't hunt animals for pleasure and we gave up our lives to protect trees but now we struggle to keep a handful of tigers alive with earth shattering advice from WWF and PETA.

Ours was a land of thick expansive forests and life giving rivers but now we pollute the Ganga to export leather to the birthplaces of Greenpeace and Amnesty international. 

Our poems conveyed complex and precise mathematical principles but now we have slam poetry competitions, sponsored by international publishing houses, debating if sanskrit should be 'imposed' on school children. 

Our gods gave all of Asia a glimpse of infinity but now we talk of our gods as temporal symbols of human dullness and wonder about the relevance of a temple at the birthplace of the divine king worshipped all over Asia. 

Our universities attracted the best minds of the world but now our colleges produce indoctrinated skunks who celebrate victimhood and mediocrity while demanding azaadi for people who burn libraries and ban movies. 

Our vision of humanity didn't correlate skin colour with God's favour but now we stand accused of being Hindu supremacists by deluded champions of misguided egalitarianism.

Our texts say we were always here but the onus of disproving the concocted Aryan invasion is patronizingly placed on our shoulders by rabid evangelists masquerading as journalists. 

Our women never had to cover their heads or skin but now we get lectured about the freedom granted by the hijab by a girl who nearly got killed for not wearing one (properly).

Our civilization was built on the foundations of debate and dialogue but now we get free lessons on tolerance and free speech by people who invented the notion of blasphemy.

The post modernists got it right because they know the rules of the game too well. Truth matters not, power does.

Reclaim your temples. Honour your gods. Care for mother earth. Speak the truth, infuse it with power. Cultivate shakti. It's not the right thing to do, it is the only thing to do.

We want the ‘Hindu way of life’ (HWL) to survive, we can look around and see how other cultures do it.

The international coverage of all such misguided ventures is very distressing but just dessert.

I too feel that In India, we need to understand our rich history, culture, philosophy and heritage. Otherwise if we continue live on on the history diet fed by colonizers we will for ever be uncomfortable with our national identity.

[3/8/18, 12:00:08 PM] ‪+65 9668 5499‬: My modern day example is of Singapore who chose strongly to focus on English. They felt that they couldn’t progress fast enough if they didn’t focus on English.
I am not sure India can look at France and Germany to compare:
- we aren’t a hindi language nation. We have multiple languages, cultures and facets
- it takes a very strong economic support (even blockade of the western concepts) to make the local culture override. We don’t have the Economic might for that.

Revisionist approach will not build a stronger economy. You could easily calculate the economic slowdown if our target becomes ‘emphasize HWL’

The Hindu is read by people who are not sure who's country it is.

The Indian Express is read by people who shouldn't run the country.

Statesman is read by people who think they ought to run the country.

Asian Age is read by people who think someone else should run the country.

The Hindustan Times is read by people who think Delhi is a country.

The Telegraph is read by people who think Bengal is the best country.

Malayalam Manorama is read by people who think only Kerala is their country, and God's ... ZIMBLE!

Mid-Day is read by people who can't think in this country.

Pioneer is read by people who think the Brits ran this country better.

The Tribune is read by people who're more bothered about the country-side.

Dainik Bhaskar is read by people in the country-side.

Bombay Samachar is read by people who'd rather be in some other country.

Saamna is read by semi-literates who think, tujhya-aiee-chi, everyone should  just clear out from their State.

Femina is read by the wives of the rich in this country.

DNA is not read, but used to pack footwear by people going out of this country.

HERALD is used in Goa to wrap Feni bottles and Joao Inacio sausages.

It’s only a matter of time before it gets branded as a mini JNU.

[3/9/18, 10:36:24 AM] Krs Jamwal: Dear MLN, I remember you as a fairly chilled person from campus, but many of your recent comments have either sarcastic or bitter overtones. I respect your political views but we are all old friends, not irritable old men (I hope) so lets not get too aggro please.  Affly. J
[3/9/18, 10:36:35 AM] Sachit Jain: If I am correct, and Prof can vouch for it, it is this govt that has given significantly more autonomy to the IIMs and we could check how much interference is there at present. Is it more or less than before?
[3/9/18, 10:38:29 AM] Sachit Jain: So let us celebrate in the acknowledged and recognised excellence of something created by one of our old friends and hope it flourishes even more, he sets up newer campuses and more such institutions come up in the future

[3/9/18, 10:46:25 AM] VMK: Try sit down on the ground and stand up without the support of your hands... That shows how healthy your heart is on a scale of 1 to 10 ... Hmmm.... interesting...

[3/9/18, 10:49:53 AM] JB Jagdish Bajaj: Bichoo.. it indeed is a great and bold initiative to have a world class academic institution. More power to you and the founders. 
Really proud of you 🌹✨🎉💐🌟💰👌🏻👍🏻🌹
[3/9/18, 10:53:04 AM] Sachit Jain: We all tried this in Goa in the mini TSB
[3/9/18, 10:54:05 AM] Sachit Jain: We agreed that women and Rahul and Vishy were fit. My memory is failing but maybe Prof too. Most others are going to die soon!
[3/9/18, 10:55:32 AM] VMK: That’s a ‘confidant’ prediction!
[3/9/18, 10:56:51 AM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: Oh really. Ashoka Univ runs on tax payers money. One prof guiding 30 mphil or phd student there or ex students still occupying hostel there.
[3/9/18, 10:57:38 AM] Sachit Jain: You mean JNU
[3/9/18, 10:58:13 AM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: Response to mln fear ashoka being targetted by modi gang
[3/9/18, 10:58:40 AM] Sachit Jain: Oops, totally missed the sarcasm their. Apologies
[3/9/18, 11:00:42 AM] ‪+65 9777 3149‬: Well done Bichoo. Awesome to see the brand grow from strength to strength
[3/9/18, 11:01:41 AM] Sachit Jain: A realistic prediction. And more a hope.

Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. We need a strong opposition and Congress is the only party at present that I see which can play that role and like it or not it s
Is the personal property of the Gandhis! 

So yes I hope and he becomes better
[3/9/18, 11:03:46 AM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: I don't know. Datelined yesterday. So thought may be current one.

[3/9/18, 11:04:55 AM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: But his sidestepping to direct question is smart n aggro. No more lamb before arnab goswami.

[3/9/18, 11:13:29 AM] Arvind Sahay: The IIM Bill certainly gives more autonomy. But it came after a fairly string dust up. If the previous MHRD had had her way, we would have become a government department. 

IIMA and to some extent, B, L and I had multiple rounds of conversations with the ministry before it came about. And we got a lot of help from IIM alumni in government. 

In fairness, we had a similar fight with the previous regime as well. 

Ashoka has also had its run ins with the government. It is an enormously humongously creditable achievement. There is a chance, that IIMA may be collaborating with Ashoka on some things...
[3/9/18, 11:17:36 AM] Sachit Jain: We shall be eagerly watching this space
[3/9/18, 11:19:26 AM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: It already has by the Hindu right wing
[3/9/18, 11:23:29 AM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: IIMA is already collaborating with Ashoka on some entrepreneurship courses
[3/9/18, 11:26:34 AM] Krs Jamwal: Very sad. Can the batch not do anything to help? Can I?
[3/9/18, 11:27:04 AM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Nothing to be done. We are ignoring and that’s fine
[3/9/18, 11:28:16 AM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: BTW from those who are not happy with JNU - what is the reason you are not happy
[3/9/18, 11:30:08 AM] Rajesh Singh: Not known for educational excellence, appears to be more a hotbed of politics
[3/9/18, 11:34:05 AM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Tell me one govt funded university in India that is known for education excellence
[3/9/18, 11:38:48 AM] Rajesh Singh: AIIMS
NITIE
SPA, New Delhi come to mind but not comparable to a full fledged Univ like JNU
[3/9/18, 11:39:44 AM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: If the Hindu Rightwing crazies are critical of Ashoka then we must be doing something good 😊
[3/9/18, 11:54:29 AM] Kavi: grrr
[3/9/18, 11:55:04 AM] Kavi: will need to find offline time to view the video

[3/9/18, 12:03:09 PM] Sridhar Mudan: Wondering what is common. The rest make occasional shows of anger. Sorry, you dont fit in AC
[3/9/18, 12:27:13 PM] VMK: A new controversy on channels. The longer version is said to be released by Congress party. And the person who asked the question (PK Basu) is claiming the version released by Congress is doctored.
[3/9/18, 12:30:13 PM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: Offcourse you are good n that's why they are critical otherwise they would have ignored. Understand during wwii in the midst of blitz in london oxford refused to give moral support to war effort n churchill just ignored. Liberal univs rebellion shd be accepted but shd have excellence.  You cant say will guide 30 student research no end date no attendence reqd free acco n sibsidy food in south delhi n no accountability public money because liberal
[3/9/18, 12:34:22 PM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: I am buying the book. Its embarrasing that Rao did not even get cremation in Delhi. The guy who had the political courage to give us reform also because not from family.
[3/9/18, 12:35:56 PM] JB Jagdish Bajaj: IIMA 😇
[3/9/18, 12:43:36 PM] VMK: True. But to be fair to Rahul, he did handle it well especially after the second pro-Congress person asked his question.
[3/9/18, 12:45:15 PM] Sachit Jain: IITs
[3/9/18, 12:46:00 PM] Sachit Jain: They are idiots. How about govt?
[3/9/18, 12:47:26 PM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: Yes excellent parrying even to first guy. Apna Babua bara ho giya from Arnab Goswami days.
[3/9/18, 12:48:22 PM] Sridhar Mudan: Left leaning intellectuals with no accountability are as scary as right leaning fundamentalists. Karni seva in a intellectual format.
[3/9/18, 12:52:23 PM] Alok Gupta: When we were in iit,we loved to go to  JNU. The canteen was better. The "vibes " were better. JNU was really cool and chilled out. Kurta and jhola was the order of the day
[3/9/18, 12:53:15 PM] Alok Gupta: Loonies are loonies , whether rightwing or leftwing.
[3/9/18, 12:56:55 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: It is not a Univ

[3/9/18, 12:58:10 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Again not a Univ.
[3/9/18, 12:59:12 PM] ‪+91 99000 94149‬: But he need not have picked the PM unnecessarily in an international forum Shows inexperience and petty minded ness
[3/9/18, 1:02:18 PM] Sridhar Mudan: The PM uses international fora to badmouth congress and their leaders all the time. Nothing wrong if Rahul does that when he gets a mauka
[3/9/18, 1:09:20 PM] Vasu: True that
[3/9/18, 1:12:13 PM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: But IITs can be compared with jnu with single campus no other affiliated college, tax  payer funded fm begining  n admission criterion open.
[3/9/18, 1:21:00 PM] ‪+91 99000 94149‬: No 
Even in Davos shameless Rahul Gandhi asked Modi why richest 1 percent of Indians hold 73 percent of the country’s wealth 
Shameless family amassed wealth by looting the country for 70 years , Chidambaram ‘s c company, Etc

[3/9/18, 2:01:11 PM] Krs Jamwal: Wow! This significantly changes my opinion of Rahul. If this is the new Rahul, I may become a congress supporter again.
[3/9/18, 2:02:01 PM] Kavi: they all suck <tm> (but ymmv - your mileage may vary ;) )
[3/9/18, 2:05:00 PM] Alok Gupta: The bar for rahul.is set really low. But even if he was coherent and logical ,my biggest objection that he has not held any governing post at all. People pitchforked  directly into the top job tend to flounder
[3/9/18, 2:05:57 PM] ‪+65 9668 5499‬: Nailed it well!
[3/9/18, 2:07:37 PM] Krs Jamwal: Well if Rahul picks the right people at the state level....if I see him picking a Milind Deora in Maharashtra and an Aditya Scindia in MP I will  gain more confidence
[3/9/18, 2:09:15 PM] ‪+65 9777 3149‬: I was in a small group  lunch with him yesterday. It was a pleasant couple of hours and he spoke about the country’s challenges , but he shared nothing about what he would do to address them
[3/9/18, 2:11:21 PM] Krs Jamwal: Still gotta vote Kavi....🤔
[3/9/18, 2:11:55 PM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: His father was also pitchforked. Schoolbuddies n trusted babus advised him. Will have similar arrangements. Don't worry.
[3/9/18, 2:12:48 PM] Krs Jamwal: Obama?
[3/9/18, 2:13:09 PM] Krs Jamwal: 😊
[3/9/18, 2:14:36 PM] Kavi: Tired lines but still ...

… Going to the candidates' debate 
Laugh about it, shout about it 
When you've got to choose 
Every way you look at this you lose…
[3/9/18, 2:16:27 PM] ‪+65 9668 5499‬: I would thinks it’s early days to start unwrapping the ‘proposition’ and ‘our solutions’.
Has luxury of time at hand. Time to collect these low hanging ‘taaliyan’.
Time to attack and land proposals......closer to dates
[3/9/18, 2:16:33 PM] Krs Jamwal: Ok....maybe you're right. Let me go into making money big-time..
[3/9/18, 2:16:56 PM] Kavi: :-) good conclusion
[3/9/18, 2:21:58 PM] Alok Gupta: Obama was the exception plus he did go to law school etc. Rahul has what education? I forget?
[3/9/18, 2:23:05 PM] Arvind Sahay: Visiting faculty from IImA. Yes. This could be more institutional.
[3/9/18, 2:25:16 PM] ‪+91 99000 94149‬: I think he was a college drop out 
Or something like that
[3/9/18, 2:25:22 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: If they were rightwing non intellectuals with tacit govt support and no accountability it would have been fine I am sure
[3/9/18, 2:25:50 PM] Sachit Jain: No. That is equally abhorring
[3/9/18, 2:26:20 PM] Sachit Jain: But the intellectuals do a greater damage
[3/9/18, 2:26:38 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Actually that is more abhorring. Because those guys are out on the streets lynching people. These guys at least don’t get violent
[3/9/18, 2:27:44 PM] Sachit Jain: India is an intolerant country and fathers lynch daughters for marrying out of the caste and so on
[3/9/18, 2:32:15 PM] Sridhar Mudan: I have equated both. Equally abhorrent.

[3/9/18, 6:50:36 PM] Venkatesh Kini: Watched only a little bit of this clip and the long winded non question by the first person on the mic. I thought he was disrespectful to Rahul and had no business using this forum to score political points.
[3/9/18, 6:52:22 PM] Vasu: Also have to keep in mind the globalised context- multiple direct international flights and constant online interaction. People now can march to the beat of a distant drummer
[3/9/18, 6:53:34 PM] Venkatesh Kini: And I’m no Raga fan myself. I just feel that decency has taken a back seat in the current polarized environment. (I also acknowledge my own tendency to get into acrimonious debate when riled)
[3/9/18, 7:06:36 PM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: It seems like people use different yardsticks to judge criticism of  RaGa and that of Modi. There is a subtle form of racism in this. It's as if Modi can be called virtually anything from 'Chaiwala' 56 inch, to Mout ka Saudagar, but poor, sweet, handsome, pedigreed RaGa must be spoken to courteously, respectfully, decently.
[3/9/18, 7:07:36 PM] ‪+65 9668 5499‬: To his face.......? Specifically what raga mentioned in his response
[3/9/18, 7:09:20 PM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: Does it matter? To his face and/or to the best watched and read media?

Regardless I would have reacted the same  if someone sent me a video of Modi being insulted in a global televised forum
[3/9/18, 7:28:09 PM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: But it's true. He does not have illustrious family. His english pronunciation  is funny n still has cocky confidence n sense of style. Compare that with Rajiv Gandhi as PM. We all knew he was a greenhorn, had no political instinct but still loved him n belueved in him till he tied himself up in bofors.
[3/9/18, 7:30:37 PM] Nikesh: It is a cut and thrust of political life. Rajiv Gandhi would have responded with some elegance, corrected the man gently and moved on. Indira Gandhi would have frozen the man with one look and said this question does not deserve an answer. Jawaharlal Nehru would have taken each part of the question and with his intellect demolished the question. Rahul suffers because he does not have facts at his command like his great-grandfather. Nor does he have enough frost in his spine like his grandmother. He does not possess the easy inheritance of his father either. 
He is a new age prince, reluctant, insecure, hounded by class enemies.
[3/9/18, 7:31:05 PM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: Rajdeep as anchor insulted him in HT conclave before pm n he beautifully batted. But even Rahul batted well n the guy was offcourse set by BJP given his aggression.

At Berkeley he did reasonably, came across as a person good at heart and  very honest at accepting his and his party's mistakes. A bit soft on facts. I remember that he had stuff out of whack on Kashmir for example.
[3/9/18, 8:02:15 PM] Venkatesh Kini: Eloquently said as always Niks
[3/9/18, 8:04:11 PM] Nikesh: We don't like it but he is the Congress president so we need to take his utterances seriously. Much like Mr. Modi who has to be taken seriously because he is the PM. These two have to as good ol' Bill said "suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune".

[3/9/18, 8:08:12 PM] Vasu: These Q&As test his brain. The more vital question is - does he have a spine? Can he stand up to the scamsters? Will he become a MMS-like puppet? The swiftness with which he moved on Mani Aiyar won him some points
[3/9/18, 8:11:57 PM] Nikesh: I am an observer. Our country throws up these gentlemen as the leadership gene pool. Clearly at this time, he is not recognised as a top quality leader but he is part of the gene pool so we have to measure him critically.
[3/9/18, 8:13:06 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: As is yours 😊
[3/9/18, 8:19:11 PM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: Oh absolutely. But arguably with good or at least, relatively, much better reason.  😊
[3/9/18, 8:19:26 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Only arguably
[3/9/18, 8:21:10 PM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: Our largest party 'threw him up" only because he was the son of Sonia Gandhi! The Gene pool for prospective Congress PM candidates has been palpably bare.
[3/9/18, 8:22:51 PM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: The argument is very one sided currently in favor of Modi, unfortunately.
[3/9/18, 8:23:12 PM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: Unfortunately for some...😊
[3/9/18, 8:27:55 PM] Sridhar Mudan: Bichu, will write to you off-group . With my network of international experts I am seeing how we can bring behavior analysis as a field of study in India. People like me had to spend a small fortune to study from US universities. Will be grateful for any suggestions, pointers on the first steps. Any others who may have ideas also let me know off group. Thanks.
[3/9/18, 8:43:44 PM] ‪+91 97116 64452‬: A tough question asked to Rahul in Singapore. Refers to the years between 1947 and 1991 when members of his family were PM for 38 out of 44 years. 
India’s growth rate was less than the world growth rate and this was condescendingly dubbed as the Hindu growth rate. Well, in the 27 years since then, India has grown at a faster rate than the world. 
So clearly the issue wasn’t with the Hindus but Nehru/Gandhi’s.

Not surprisingly, Congress put up a doctored video on its website which misrepresents the sequence of events that occurred in the meeting which hides Rahul’s inability to answer the question. And now the author who asked the question is threatening to expose them!!!

[3/9/18, 10:07:56 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Is this the Sagarika comment you are referring to

PK, have also criticised Nehru-Gandhi economic illiberalism but you have to accept that It was Nehruvian modernism, like it or not, that gave India its modern institutions & orientation, now being irretrievably reversed by your ilk peddling its mythological gau mutra economics

Without @OfficeOfRG 's great grandfather @PrasenjitKBasu wouldn't be in Singapore, wouldn't speak English, wouldn't have written a book in English, instead would be a cow dung trader busily drinking cow urine and puzzling over ten headed demons riding flying chariots
[3/9/18, 10:37:25 PM] Nikesh: 1. Some interesting points on manufacturing.  Acknowledges issues with large factories but does not provide a good alternative solution. 
2. Seems to have some kernels of real thought on the subject around services {barbers}  but it gets buried under platitudes. 
3. Makes a significant point about large data driving healthcare. Mukesh, Harish, perhaps you two can opine. 
4. Alas, some factually incorrect statements at the end. He seems to have Kashmir facts completely out of whack.

Rubbish, Lalu @sagarikaghose His greatgrandfather was made PM of the dominion at Britain’s behest. The PCCs chose Patel and Kripalani. My grandfather outdid JL Nehru at Cambridge. So stop trying to be such a politician and patronise me without an iota of facts.

[3/9/18, 10:53:49 PM] Nikesh: SV
It's easy with hindsight to believe that India could have done better without JLN and IG. I think Nehru played an incredibly crucial role in holding India together. Without him we would have been many countries. Mrs G I am not so sure.
[3/9/18, 10:56:10 PM] Nikesh: Post 71 she embarked on a journey of self aggrandizement which ended in the Emergency. That period saw excesses and destruction of institutions like never before or after, present time included.

[3/10/18, 6:39:29 AM] ‪+65 9476 4788‬: *Oops he does it again!!!*

Yesterday Shri Rahul Gandhi had gone to the National University of Singapore to address the students of Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (Brand-building tour, arranged by Sam Pitroda). After the address got over, the moderator invited questions from the audience.

PK Basu, who teaches Economic History at several business schools in Singapore and is author of the book 'Asia Reborn' had a question to ask.

BASU: Mr. Gandhi! Why is it that during the years your family ruled India, India's per capita income was growing less than the world average. And yet, in the years since your family relinquished the prime ministership of India, India's per capita income has grown substantially faster than the world average?

RAGA (knowing not what to answer, tries to buy time): Ehh...What is your hypothesis? 

BASU: I asked you a question. So answer my question...My hypothesis is in my book. Please read the book. It's called 'Asia Reborn.' (audience laughs)

RAGA: I mean...I mean...You are giving hell lot of power to one family.

BASU: Since you asked back a question, let me elaborate my question a bit. 

(A nervous RaGa picks up the water bottle and starts drinking water).

BASU: At the point of independence, India's per capita income was one of the lowest in the world. India's life expectancy at birth was 32 years, the lowest in the world. Africa's average was 38...So when you are the poorest country in the world, you should be growing faster than the world average, in order to close the gap. Unfortunately, during the period of your family's rule, India did not achieve that. 

MODERATOR intervenes (sensing that RaGa is finding it difficult to answer the question): When there's a sharp question, you can either decide to take it or not.

RAGA (embarrased at moderator's suggestion): Let me try it...let me try it...

MODERATOR: OK, go ahead !

RAGA (literally fumbling for words): Do you agree... ...First of all, I... ...Do you agree, that India is a success today?

BASU: Of course.

RAGA: Success since when?

BASU: Since your family relinquished prime ministership of India.

(Audience bursts into laughter)

[3/10/18, 7:34:31 AM] ‪+91 99000 94149‬: This is a very crooked and skewed view of Hindutva 
First of all 
Hinduism teaches that only if you lose materialistic nature in your life you can reach God 
But that is towards the end of one’s life or as and when one is ready to meet the preceptor . For various people it happens at various times 
Unfortunately it does not happen for many 
 In your life and if you believe God and offer worship to him by doing puja our ancestors have devised a method to Request all good things in life from the preceptor by clearly saying who you are and what you want etc 
This is called sankalpa 
Hindu Philosophy has never ever portrayed Riches and getting rich overnight as the theme . 
This must be put by some idiotic crooks 
Despicable

All this in 3 years while amazon has been just farting around and doing PR shows. He took a couple of digs at them 😊.

[3/10/18, 12:53:49 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: It is doing the rounds in Delhi. I got it on my school group. Allegedly shopkeepers in Amar Colony whose shops were sealed recently. Traders have been up in arms for the past three months in Delhi. All the Municipal Corporations are controlled by the BJP. AAP is sensing a huge opportunity here
[3/10/18, 12:54:55 PM] ‪+91 98103 60586‬: Destroyed all norms first. Today whatever he does has become normal.
[3/10/18, 12:56:31 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Traders have historically been the core support group of the BJP
[3/10/18, 12:58:47 PM] ‪+91 99000 94149‬: Delhi traders believe in cash and carry business with no trace of transactions present whatsoever and wheresoever
[3/10/18, 12:59:22 PM] ‪+91 99000 94149‬: Discipline thoda mushkil hai Bhai
[3/10/18, 12:59:49 PM] Arvind Sahay: Will he need the traders nationwide? How many votes are they?
[3/10/18, 1:00:25 PM] Kavi: I heard on the street that a significant court date is coming up soon on the sealing issue. These demonstrations may have something to do with that
[3/10/18, 1:11:59 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Blame it on my poor hindi. Is he cursing Modi or Kejriwal ? Or both??
[3/10/18, 1:12:33 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Modi and Amit Shah
[3/10/18, 1:13:19 PM] Arvind Sahay: Yep. Definitely sounding off against Modi and Shah.
[3/10/18, 1:17:53 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: I don't know how long the receiving party listened like this without retaliating with equally strong expletives !
[3/10/18, 1:22:36 PM] Arvind Sahay: Only if you allow it . Obama had style and decorum. Trump has none... at least by one set of standards. 

I suspect, as a group we may be partial to style and decorum. 

Sample: 

In Parliament: 19th century Britain. 

Gladstone to Disraeli: You will die either on the gallows or of an unspeakable disease. 

Disraeli to gladstone: That, Sir, depends on whether i embrace your principles or your wife.
[3/10/18, 1:22:47 PM] ‪+91 94267 00946‬: There is a huge resentment against BJP in Delhi. They were unhappy about demo and GST. But you could blame it in them. Lack of business ethics, cash economy etc etc. 

But ceiling is a genuine concern and people facing problem for no fault of their own. Many have paid fine and penalties for regularisation and after that facing ceiling.
[3/10/18, 1:25:42 PM] ‪+91 98202 24603‬: Who ordered the sealing? Was it the municipal corporation or the court?

 In agra  my friend a bansal n leader of traders. given up on him. BJP has to abandon oldest support base n move to bottom 70% of pyramid. Upper middle class non business also family immovable property value will stagnate for a decade n value destruction.
[3/10/18, 1:41:47 PM] VMK: 👏👏👏

[3/10/18, 1:51:24 PM] Krs Jamwal: Will check Shumone but that was roughly the rate for that 5000 car tender
[3/10/18, 1:52:22 PM] Kavi: Looks great, what are the trophies for ?
[3/10/18, 1:52:25 PM] Vasu: 👏👏
[3/10/18, 1:53:19 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Absolutely this is the problem. I too used to hear from our rural  dealers that still no.2 business is going on from Delhi region as has been the practice for so many many years. It used to  be the concern for me  why GST is not implemented properly for Delhi business. If this protest is in response to the sealing of shops who do.not follow GST, then I am happier now because the govt.and the implementing officials  are showing their steadfastedness in dealing with the one of strong vote banks just to ensure compliance by all sections of people.
[3/10/18, 1:54:55 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Can somebody explain what for these trophies are to those uninitiated like me ?
[3/10/18, 1:55:22 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Anyway, congratulations to him for bagging so many trophies !

[3/10/18, 2:17:07 PM] Arvind Sahay: 👍
[3/10/18, 2:19:14 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: This sealing has nothing to do with GST
[3/10/18, 2:20:05 PM] Kavi: I think the sealing is for zoning issues, on which successive govts have flip flopped. From 2 personal data points, traders in Delhi are no different from the ones in Hyd ...
[3/10/18, 2:21:14 PM] Kavi: Or for that matter Bhopal where I also have personal experience.  They all suck <tm>
[3/10/18, 2:29:05 PM] Nikesh: Congratulations Kiddo. Good to see you grow 😀
[3/10/18, 2:39:35 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Well done Anurag
[3/10/18, 2:43:35 PM] ‪+91 98408 56130‬: Fantastic Anurag, you more success
[3/10/18, 2:43:52 PM] Sridhar Mudan: Well done Anurag, Award winning Photographer and Awards winning  Digital Marketer. Hope to celebrate this with you some day
[3/10/18, 2:44:37 PM] Shumone: To a strapping young confident man! Our efforts and sacrifices have paid off Niks!!
[3/10/18, 2:44:44 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: If this govt.stands up to the powerful lobby and implement tough decision, we should appreciate ...irrespective of AAP or BJP or Congi. But we all know how most of the parties behave. In my neighbourhood, there has been a case going for the last 18 years ( yes, we have to believe) for  extending the busy/congested  road from 40' to 80'. Most of the land/shops are occupied by DMK/ADMK and one church. Every time the case comes up, they get the stay for demolition due to DMK/ADMK influence. No political will. We the people are the sufferers!
[3/10/18, 2:45:52 PM] Rashesh Shah: Anurag..... Well done. Congrats👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
[3/10/18, 2:53:10 PM] Vasu: You sound like you both adopted Anurag
[3/10/18, 2:56:20 PM] Kavi: So pointless to blame cash loving traders. They will do what works best for them to survive. 

Delhi has to solve its zoning problem, not just compliance, but the actual policies which seem to have become instruments of harassment and not much else
[3/10/18, 2:58:37 PM] ‪+44 7881 856583‬: Hey kiddo!! Awesome!! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
[3/10/18, 3:01:19 PM] ‪+44 7881 856583‬: VERY HIMBLE REQUEST. can we please at least take the political discussions/debate to another sub group! Else we end up deleting messages and might loose good ones like kiddos achievement of some of the new tech or interesting posts like the drones delivering blood in Rwanda etc
[3/10/18, 3:02:17 PM] Kavi: I have evolved a filter in my brain ;-)
[3/10/18, 3:12:55 PM] ‪+44 7881 856583‬: Pray tell me the technique. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
[3/10/18, 3:31:28 PM] ‪+91 99000 94149‬: This is the problem in Delhi not started because of BJP governing all three municipal corporations . It is because of the Supreme Court monitoring committee which has put some yardsticks on Zoning and other bye law requirements . The problem has been from 2006 . It was there in congress period too. The Local Government needs to  pass a law which regularises these transgressions . Instead of blaming Modi for everything let Mr A K pass a law . He has the necessary strength to do so
[3/10/18, 3:37:36 PM] VMK: He has? After disqualifications  and arrests for assaulting officials?😉
[3/10/18, 3:39:03 PM] ‪+91 99000 94149‬: That is the issue 
An inept C M who cannot do anything to redress this issue , is seen barking that BJP is the root cause for everything
[3/10/18, 3:40:12 PM] Anurag Gupta: Thanks Shumone, Vinod, VMK, chaks, rano, Arnab, Kavi , MS Ramesh, amit, Ambuj, deva, prof , Sampa , Nikesh , Bichhoo, Chandra , Sridhar , Rashesh !

[3/10/18, 5:08:35 PM] Sridhar Mudan: Lets start a controversy. Some bhakt should say is masjid is included in things we see daily why temple is not included 🙂

[3/10/18, 5:32:53 PM] Krs Jamwal: While not wanting to be prescriptive in what people speak on here, I have to say I cannot fathom why political battles have to be fought amongst friends. Who cares whether you support Namo or Raga, it's your personal choice - go vote when you have the opportunity

[3/10/18, 5:38:30 PM] Kavi: spice of life yaar, the most fun part of weekends is watching this group go clickety clack :)
[3/10/18, 5:39:53 PM] Sridhar Mudan: This used to happen in street corners, chai shops, verandahs of houses, addas in kolkata etc. People with time in hand engage in raging and fierce political debates. The closed whatsapp group provide similar freedom and environmemt. Of late Only mild gents like mln do not join  debates 🙂. Let it continue. My hypothesis is that it will only strengthen the bonds of friendship. My political knowledge is very superficial, but these exchanges here seem ok
[3/10/18, 5:40:30 PM] ‪+91 98103 60586‬: It shows how much government dominates our hearts and minds. Universal access to information makes it a natural meeting ground.

Liberal men will disagree but they will go with their current politician leanings - those who are bhakts will find a way to justify this and those who are against BJP will use this as one more support for their arguments. Conservative women will support this view or at least will not get hassled by it.

[3/10/18, 6:49:42 PM] Kavi: that's physical protection against assault

what yogi's saying is about protection against ones' own judgement, passions and instincts. Sort of the british position on their colonial subjects ;)

[3/10/18, 6:56:04 PM] Kavi: social conditioning, over millenia, someone needs to stay at home and look after the kids, so we have literally evolved ourselves to persuade women into that role (said persuasion based on one simple axiom - women give birth, not men, ergo ...). The rest is just politics as most of our daughters will eloquently inform us if prodded ...
[3/10/18, 6:59:07 PM] Arvind Sahay: Well most religion and divinity is fairly male centric... Hinduism (at least some forms of it) is an exception.
[3/10/18, 7:00:36 PM] Arvind Sahay: Well biologically and neurotransmitter wise, there is no question (at least as per current science) that women are way better at looking after children...
[3/10/18, 7:05:16 PM] ‪+65 9668 5499‬: No running away from the face of daily life - indian families and women don’t believe ‘all hands on the oars’.

[3/10/18, 7:13:27 PM] ‪+91 99000 94149‬: I agree with you Jammie . We need to respect each one’s view . I don’t want to really try and change others opinion through this forum but just put up my point of view . 
But when an immediate rejoinder sometimes incorrect , sometimes correct appear then it continues to clarify or refute that rejoinder . Really there is no end to it except that I take it as understanding others point of view . The switch is always with you whether you are going to buy the other point of view or not and you are your own best judge . 
Sometimes I also enjoy nudging others a bit to see how strong their point of view is 
E.g. Recently a 10 year old clipping was put by Sanjeev and he immediately corrected when it was pointed out . 
All in the game until no one takes personally . 
Incidentally Prasad is really one of my close friends and he nudges me a bit and I do it 
It is all fine if at the end of the day there is a light hearted laughter

Education, yes, everywhere. Surely prioritize rural
[3/10/18, 7:43:44 PM] Krs Jamwal: I wonder why more people do not talk of irrigation for farmers rather than loan waivers. To my mind it's been the biggest failure towards farmers and agriculture. From Wikipedia:
According to 2001/2002 Agriculture census, only 58.1 million hectares of land was actually irrigated in India.[30] The total arable land in India is 160 million hectares (395 million acres). According to the World Bank, only about 35% of total agricultural land in India was reliably irrigated in 2010.
[3/10/18, 7:44:03 PM] Krs Jamwal: From my LinkedIn post
[3/10/18, 7:47:07 PM] Rajesh Singh: There has to be a shift to less water intensive  crops and better agri techniques as well
[3/10/18, 7:56:04 PM] Arvind Sahay: Need a critical mass of such activity before the epigenetic changes that follow make the new norms widespread enough to be dominant. Do not see that happening in the forseeable future.
[3/10/18, 7:58:34 PM] Alok Gupta: One issue is wrong crops. Maharashtra for example . Sugarcane acreage increased dramatically as  it yielded more money. Water availability was never enough so ground water was merrily drained .now inb the last ten years as ground water started running out ,we are seeing consequences which are getting worse
[3/10/18, 7:58:39 PM] Arvind Sahay: I remember reading an Indian source about a year ago saying that the % of arable area irrigated is about 50. Reliably? Not sure. Jammy, if we were able to shift en masse to drip irrigation- what would be the reduction in water usage? 80%?
[3/10/18, 8:08:40 PM] Kavi: It’s a disruption of the evolutionary process we are seeing. The outcome could be rather dramatic (see the movie gattaca)
[3/10/18, 8:11:49 PM] Krs Jamwal: Between 60-80% if i recall for vegetables etc. Actually predictable water availability would ensure few disastrous years if any, then a gradual surplus in the hands of the farmer, then hi yield varieties and remunerative crops. It's a sequence...
[3/10/18, 8:13:55 PM] Krs Jamwal: No point doing hi yield when monsoon fails. Losses are higher

[3/10/18, 8:30:53 PM] ‪+91 93240 60495‬: At the age of 57, John B. Goodenough invented the lithium battery which powers all our smart phones, tablets and laptops - as well as electric cars.

37 years later at the age of 94, John has unveiled a new, ultra-efficient, low cost battery which uses a sodium or lithium coated glass electrolyte. It will dwarf his original invention and make it redundant.

The new glass battery will allow electric cars to go three times the distance, and recharge in minutes instead of hours. It's also far safer as it won't explode and can operate in sub-zero temperatures.

The new glass battery will power our future solar powered and electric vehicles, homes and industries.

But John isn't finished yet. He still works every day as a Professor at the University of Texas.

John believes humanity has a 30 year window to come up with an even more powerful "super battery" to take us entirely off fossil fuels, before the environmental damage we are creating becomes irreversible, and says, "I want to solve this problem before my chips are in ..... I still have time to go."

So if you ever think it's too late to be successful, just remember John B. Goodenough.

https://news.utexas.edu/2017/02/28/goodenough-introduces-new-battery-technology
[3/10/18, 8:34:30 PM] Kavi: well ... the evidence is all structural right now :
1) gay marriage is increasingly acceptable and legal
2) artificial insemination is a mature technology
3) surrogate motherhood is a mature technology
4) exowomb (artificial uterus) has been demonstrated for lamb fetuses, one can only guess at when it becomes real for humans

Now, we have plenty of artificially inseminated babies and surrogate nurtured babies in the envmt, but not enough data on how that has changed female roles. From some personal observations, couples who have gone for surrogate motherhood have had dual stressful careers.

So ... too early to bet on a complete redefinition of female role in society ?

All four taken together at this point in time - even in a country like the US add up to less than - i would guess - 0.1 % of the births. For the epigenetic effect to kick in at a society wide level, to get to the so called tipping point, i would warrant requires a minimum of 10% of the births in a society - 100 times higher than where it is today.

But the contours of the transition are quite interesting. Your 0.1% number .... how do you think it holds up when you go to (say) San Francisco ? or even all of South California ? I suspect you will see pockets of change in certain cities faster than elsewhere .

On average, 

1. The number of nerve fibres connecting the left and right hemispheres are different by an order of magnitude
2. Spatial visualization areas of the brain are different in size. 
3. Neurotransmitters like oxytocin, vasopressin, dopamine, serotonin have  very different baseline levels.

[3/11/18, 7:23:58 PM] Arvind Sahay: On fresh water. 

Some Arithmetic on a Friday Evening - Gopakumar Menon 

Name the item that India is the world’s largest exporter in.  Quick please, we are waiting.  Iron and steel?  Tomatoes? Denim? Sofware?
Not quite right.
The answer is: fresh water.  Yes, you read this right, India is the world’s largest exporter of fresh water, with a prefix added: ‘virtual’ fresh water, where water is a key input.  The most egregious examples of this are rice and sugar.

This note is about sugar.  
Now the sugarcane crushing season is ending, today’s newspaper reported that India’s production of sugar is likely to be 29.5 million tonnes, which is 4.5 million tonnes in excess of consumption.  About 10 kg of sugarcane produces 1 kg of sugar, so India grew 45 million tonnes of excess cane.

Fact: one ton of sugar consumes about 3 million litres of fresh water, largely from rivers and streams, and increasingly, from borewells.  Most of this water does not go back to its source.  
Therefore, the excess sugar produced by the country consumed 13.5 million million litres of fresh water, ie, 13500,000,000,000 litres.

So, what do we do now?  “Give us a subsidy of Rs. 10 per kg to export the sugar,” whine the sugar mills, “as the world produces excess of the stuff (as it has done for years), and the prices are down.”  The Government might agree to subsidise about 25% of this excess, say, about 1 million tonnes.  After all, there is precedence: the Hon Mr Pawar had done the same some years ago.

Let me summarise: India might, in 2018, pay Rs. 1000 crores to subsidise the export of 4000,000,000,000 litres of (virtual) fresh water to people who do not want it, from a country that does not have enough of it.

[3/11/18, 11:49:03 PM] Kavi: book review : Shashi Tharoor : An era of darkness, the british empire in India.

Mr Tharoor has fixed his unrelenting gaze upon anybody who harbors the slightest equanimity toward the period of British rule (the Raj) in India, starting with the formation of the EIC in 1600, ending August 15, 1947. He mercilessly builds a case against the British Raj, laying at its feet a neatly filled out ledger of greed, rapacity, mass murder, and above all - hypocrisy. Any lingering doubts in the reader's mind about any benefits India might have gained from the Raj are swiftly dismissed by the following rhetorical devices:

    "What if the Raj was not there, would that benefit not have arisen nevertheless? For example the abolition of Sati, or even the english language"

    OR

    "The Raj did it for its own commercial profit, at a very high cost. For example the introduction of the railways"

Mr Tharoor musters impressive evidence and research to his passionate prosecution of the British Raj and its apologists. This is a work of great intellect and devotion. The reader, especially if originally Indian, ends up helplessly drawn into agreement with the broad sweep of Mr Tharoor's persuasion, setting aside niggling doubts lest he be seen on the wrong side of the debate by his companions. In this aspect, the book is a powerful persuasion, perhaps with unintended consequences, which form the main critique of this review.

The judge in the hypothetical courtroom, where the author appears to build his case, would say : "Where are you going with this Mr Tharoor?", and  would not get a convincing answer. The book succeeds at a cathartic rebuttal of every claim of benefit to India from the British Raj, but fails to offer a clear answer to "Where do we go from here?".  Apart from a few vague ideas about symbolic , and not so symbolic - e.g. the return of kohinoor - reparations, the book concludes with a weary analysis of the residual effects of colonial misrule playing themselves out even today in the world. An admonition to the reader about learning from the past (the best crystal ball is the rear view mirror), and the author is done!

Alas, the book is highly passionate in its first 6 chapters. If you did not make it to the last two chapters, you would be in a state of furious rage, and justified in concluding that every single aspect of the British Raj was simply evil for India, and perhaps must be rolled back.

If you missed the one paragraph in chapter 7 toward the end, explaining why the author believes the mughal conquerors were ultimately Indian (they married and settled, and invested all their capital in India), you would easily extrapolate your rage against the British Raj to the Mughal period also. In this respect, this passionate book with an exhausted, petered-out conclusion could be used by hot-heads of all stripes to justify a "purification" of the worst kind.

If - as a person of Indian origin - you followed the thesis of the caste system as has having hardened during the British Raj, and understood the divisive nature of labeling communities as martial, commercial, or such, and placing those classifications on record for all time, then you will harbor  even deeper grudges against some of your fellow Indians than your forefathers did.

This then is my main critique of Mr Tharoor's book : he opens a lot of deep wounds; forces us to look at them, and feel their pain; but supplies very little to heal or close them. I hope he continues to write more on this subject, and offers a more constructive path forward that eschews some of the reactionary perils outlined above.

P.S.> The reader of this book should also read Winston Churchill's "History of the English Speaking Peoples" to complete his perspective. Mr Churchill defends the record of the British Empire and his race, with rhetorical devices very similar to those of this book. The emotional stance, however, is magnanimous and patronizing, as befits the "winner" in that period of history ...

[3/12/18, 7:11:44 AM] Kavi: oh i see it's the existing bulk that matters. Fascinating, never knew
[3/12/18, 7:17:40 AM] Kavi: well that's the problem with interpretations of history, one can speculate to suit the political climate of the time. Tharoor's point about the mughals in chap 7 is a bit deeper than just the loot, however. He points most fundamentally to the abhorrence of miscegeny among the british, a reluctance to intermarry and mix their blood with the colonial natives; this was not the case with the mughals, who settled and intermarried with the Indian population even at the level of royalty.
[3/12/18, 7:27:10 AM] Rajesh Singh: Sucrose, as in sugar, and fructose (in whole fruits) and not corn syrup as a sugar substitute, are metabolised differently in the body. Therefore fruits don't cause a spike in blood sugar despite being sweet.

This guy is Biswaroop Roy Choudhary, an Engineer by qualification but calls himself a Dr. He is not a medical professional but his claims are true. Have personally been using his recommendations to keep off the blood sugar medicines.

Isn't his job to present the case from his view point (I am not going into whether his interpretation of history is correct or otherwise) and leave the reader to infer / decide ?
[3/12/18, 8:08:39 AM] Kavi: ha, what works for the author, also works for this reviewer, i.e. not to be bound by how the author decided to scope his work

I see the book as a significant work, capable of great persuasion. Thus my critique

[3/12/18, 8:21:22 AM] Alok Gupta: Ramesh, the intermarriage  with Mughals did not account for the conversion. Forced conversions did. Also a lot many times the converted did not even realise that they were converted, when they did  realise  and wanted  to go back to Hinduism ,the priests forbade it.

Even after forced conversions many Hindus wanted to go back but were denied

[3/12/18, 8:37:46 AM] Alok Gupta: Will have have diff for that. This is based on old accounts from different sources. Not one source. There  are many accounts though of the Hindus  converted wanting to reconvert but denied especially in old Punjab, Rajasthan  and Peshawar area. 

Again I am just looking at history, no anti anybody overtones here from my side
[3/12/18, 8:45:44 AM] Rajesh Singh: The muslims were the early ones to spot this Golden Bird and came with fire power to loot and conquer this land. The technology then didn't make it possible for the riches to be carted back home. Some settled here because this was better than 'back home', this was the promised land. The British came with superior technology and organization to maximize shareholder value as the sole objective and succeeded in establishing their might against the warring kingdoms. They simply eliminated competition to establish their hegemony
[3/12/18, 8:51:24 AM] Alok Gupta: Also important to note that no advances  in military tech for almost 500 to 600 years prior to the invasions. The Hun invasions which were equally  strong and persistent still did not penetrate beyond punjab

[3/12/18, 8:58:16 AM] Kavi: Distaste for miscegenation is different from taste for profit. It has nothing to do with technology or transportation.

[3/12/18, 5:34:39 PM] JB Jagdish Bajaj: The importance of perspective and intelligent analysis... *Hope it helps in investing also*

During World War II, numerous fighter planes were getting hit by anti-aircraft guns. 

Air Force officers wanted to add some protective armor/shield to the planes. The question was "where"?

The planes could only support few more kilos of weight. A group of mathematicians and engineers were called for a short consulting project. 

Fighter planes returning from missions were analysed for bullet holes per square foot. They found 1.93 bullet holes/sq. foot near the tail of the planes whereas only 1.11 bullet holes/sq. foot close to the engine.
 
The Air Force officers thought that since the tail portion had the greatest density of bullets, that would be the logical location for putting an anti-bullet shield. 

A mathematician named Abraham Wald said exactly the opposite; more protection is needed where the bullet holes aren't - that is -around the engines.
 
His judgement surprised everyone.  He said "We are counting the planes that returned from a mission. Planes with lots of bullet holes in the engine did not return at all."

*Debrief*
 
If you go to the recovery room at the hospital, you’ll see a lot more people with bullet holes in their legs than people with bullet holes in their chests.  That’s not because people don’t get shot in the chest; it’s because the people who get shot in the chest don’t recover.

Remember the words of Einstein - "Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted, counts."

[3/12/18, 5:44:06 PM] JB Jagdish Bajaj: Not every problem needs to be fixed right now, give yourself time, everything works out at the end.

Not every negative situation needs to be stressed over, breathe, you will get through this just like you did before.

Not every battle is worth fighting, choose your battles wisely.

Not every wrinkle, pimple, grey hair, scar, double chin, dark circles need to be covered, embrace and love yourself just the way you are.

Not every individual you meet has a hidden agenda, there are still many sincerely kind people around.

Not every heartbreak is a tragedy, it can also be a great lesson and blessing in disguise.

Not every insult or criticism is worth obsessing over for the rest of your life, let it go, for your own peace of mind.

Not every pain needs to be healed immediately, some wounds take more than a lifetime to heal.

Not every memory needs to be captured by a camera, some precious memories are captured and stored in the depths of your heart and mind.

Not every aspect of your life needs to be shared on social media, remain a sweet mystery.

Not every face wears a mask of deception, some are authentic in an artificial world.

Not every failure is a disappointment, use it as a stepping stone towards your next success.

Not every cake will bake to perfection, eat it with some cream, it will taste divine.

Not every action needs a reaction.

Not everyday will be sunny, exciting, awesome, brilliant or happy but you can find beauty even on a cloudy day....

[3/13/18, 8:07:00 AM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: *The big myth on Income Tax Payers in India;*

 Data from a Chartered Accountants'Company Secretaries and other professional bodies and groups.......;
✍ FM said during his budget speech that we are largely a tax *'non- compliant'* society and presented that only *3.7 crores* are  filing ITRs in this poor country of 125 crore population .

*The reply by CAs ,CSs,CMA,s

Sir, 
We have 82 crore voters out of which,

- *75% are agriculturists*  ie. 61.5 crores ( You exempted them straightaway, but they can also buy cars , bungalows etc. as you quoted.. Your political colleagues are also enjoying this exemption) 

*Balance remains... 20.5 crores* 

*Less:24% BPL class* ( Below poverty line)

Means 15 crore population ( which is non agriculturist and non BPL) .. 

*Less : Senior Citizens, Non working wives, unemployed youths, below-taxable income earners... political class.. (say 75%)* ... in a typical indian family only 1 earning member and 5/6 are dependent on him....

*Balance: (15-11.25)=3.75 crores is the earning class ... which can file ITRs and ... they are already filing it...*

.... So almost no gap as FM  is stressing unnecessarily without knowing his country🤓😝😱

if FM wants more people to come into tax net ... then... instead foolishly resorting to rampant raids, surveys, notices, scrutiny,  demonetisations etc etc viewed as *tax terrorism*  ... he should defy his negative bureaucrats and .......

1. Introduce simple Income Tax on Agricultural Income on large landlords ( Say 10 Acres plus ) - you can add 26% of Agriculturists as tax payers *( Politicians are also enjoying this exemption )*

2. Instead of introducing 5000 /10000 penalties on late filers of IT return ...
*come out with positive approach and introduce incentives to IT return filers* ( learn from Pakistan, IT assessee gets discount in purchase of Car )

3. *Introduce Privilege card to  those paying taxes above certain limit.. privilege card to entitle assessee with benefits like Priority quota in railway tickets , Use of airport lounges, subsidised medical facilities, etc etc...  let Tax payers feel proud*

4. *Introduce medical insurance / life insurance on basis of average ITR filled... like coverage upto twice of Gross Income in ITR filed for mediclaim and ten times risk cover in case of life insurance* 

5. *Introduce Pension after 65 yrs of age on the basis of tax paid by tax payer during his working life..*

Let honest taxpayers get certain direct benefits.... 

As on today, 3.3% of Indian population is filing ITRs as compared to 8% of China...adding large agriculturists to Income Tax may shoot the figure to more than 10% .... it may help you to cool your tax terrorism mindset and a tax compliant nation ...😊

[3/13/18, 8:44:01 AM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Wrong assumptions and wrong calculation.
1. People depening in Agriculture is 60% and not 75%. Also for the time being, let us not count no.of people out of this, those earning from non-farming source also. If you take 60%, then out of 125 Cr. the balance left is  50 Cr.
24% BPL - a part of this has been accounted for in the first group itself. Lot of farmers live on subsistence farming and they are BPL. That means we have to deduct 24% not from 50 Cr but from 30 Cr  (50Cr.* 0.6) and that is 30*0.24= 7.2 Cr. The balance left out is 50 - 7.2 = 42.8 cr
3. Out of this 42.8 Cr., even if you remove 75%  for  nonworking people & others (without considering  double income families), the balance is approx. 11Cr. who are potential tax payers.
[3/13/18, 8:45:13 AM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Of course I do not agree with the methodology. I am giving the rebuttal with the same methodology used by these people

[3/13/18, 12:00:18 PM] Alok Gupta: Also because there is no bijli in the Pani,it is not attracting the clouds. Therefore raining less
[3/13/18, 12:00:27 PM] Kavi: bhai sa'b, that electrical energy is ALSO eventually converted to heat (as it is used to - say - light a bulb, or  cool a home, or run a pump). Come on man, conservation of energy !
[3/13/18, 12:01:20 PM] Kavi: your commentary will accompany the WTF writeup document
[3/13/18, 12:01:57 PM] Alok Gupta: Also in the last few years bijli shortage has come down. This is because the bijli extracted from the Pani is making up the shortfall. Modi is to blame
[3/13/18, 12:02:25 PM] Alok Gupta: Truth will out

[3/13/18, 12:24:41 PM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: No sir it is replacing coal or oil which is remaining underground. Otherwise use coal for electricity plus solar heat on barren land.
[3/13/18, 12:27:43 PM] Kavi: so your  thesis is that solar energy plants which produce electricity, somehow result in a cooling of the earth, since not all the solar energy thus processed converts to heat. Is this a correct statement of your thinking?

[3/13/18, 12:34:27 PM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: No. Solar helps keeping coal n oil unused underground n total incident solar heat plus burning of fuel ultimately converted to heat on usage is lowered.
[3/13/18, 12:36:31 PM] Kavi: ok yes that makes sense (in the short time window) thx. Basically you are arguing that burning coal instead of using solar adds to the heat in the envmt, whereas with solar, the heat incident upon the planet constant. Ok
[3/13/18, 12:47:01 PM] JB Jagdish Bajaj: Some years ago, there was a Mensa convention in San Francisco. 

Mensa, is an international organization for people who have an IQ of 140 or higher. 

Several of the Mensa members went out for lunch at a local cafe. 

When they sat down, one of them discovered that their salt shaker contained pepper, and their pepper shaker was full of salt. 

How could they swap the contents of the two bottles without spilling any, and using only the implements at hand? 

Clearly -- this was a job for Mensa minds. 

The group debated the problem and presented ideas and finally, came up with a brilliant solution involving a napkin, a straw, and an empty saucer. 

They then called the waitress over, ready to dazzle her with their solution. 

"Ma'am," they said, "we couldn't help but notice that the pepper shaker contains salt and the salt shaker contains pepper..." 

But before they could finish, the waitress interrupted & said... 

"Oh -- sorry about that." 

She leaned over the table, unscrewed the caps of both bottles and switched them. 

There was dead silence at the Mensa table. 

For most of the problems in our lives there are simple solutions, but it is our “Brilliant” minds that complicate every simple solution. ...Change the Caps and enjoy life !!
[3/13/18, 12:57:15 PM] Kavi: as long as the caps are interchangeable. Most shakers have fewer holes for salt than for pepper. Changing caps will confuse future customers and result in wrong behavior of the "system"
For all cheap solutions in life there is usually a cost to bear, sooner or later ;)
[3/13/18, 12:58:51 PM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: Indian jugaad vs western process violation.
[3/13/18, 12:59:54 PM] Kavi: well ... perhaps. Jugaad is maligned as always being a buggy hack. Some jugaad is actually the most elegant solution to problems (e.g. dabbawala), but sometimes it's just ... cheap and buggy

‘Medicine is learnt more at the bedside than from books’

Dr Farokh E Udwadia, arguably the country’s best diagnostician, on his latest book, the art of healing versus technology, and playing God

-Bachi Karkaria


He is a fervent, and eloquent, evangelist for the art of healing as distinct from the science of cure, a continuous student of the humanities. This arguably accounts for his reputation as India’s best diagnostician. *He is the colossus of Breach Candy Hospital.* _When he walks through the corridors of Parsi General, people reverentially stand up._ He has mentored thousands as professor of Medicine at JJ. *He is perhaps the last of the legendary physicians. And he is as passionate about Mozart as about the symphony of the human body.* Interviewing Dr F E Udwadia is equally elevating. Excerpts from a long conversation.

*KARKARIA*: You are quite the Renaissance man. The importance of the humanities recurs in all three of your ‘lay’ books, including the imminent *‘Tabiyat'* – Medicine and Healing in India And Other Essays (Oxford University Press).

*Dr Udwadia:* The humanities generally give you a wider perspective. And if you want to know exactly how a human being works, you will be much better off by studying them. Read poetry, literature, and you get a good idea of what suffering is. If you can appreciate your patient’s suffering, your response to his disease is much better.

*Music?*

It’s the most important of the arts. *Music unquestionably helps the healing process.* Soldiers in the World Wars convalesced better. Now it is being scientifically understood how it acts on certain parts of the brain, which perhaps control the immune response of the body to disease. Personally, it gives me a feeling of relief, of satisfaction, ennobles the spirit. Great music is a great blessing. I’m passionately fond of it.

*So let’s talk of your passion for the ‘art of healing’ as distinct from the science of cure.*

Medicine is an equal measure of art and science. Curing is science intervening to get rid of a disease or infection. _But healing involves the whole mind-body complex._ Important distinction. There are conditions which you cannot cure, but you may be able to heal a fair amount of anxiety and discomfort. *Not uncommonly, the problem is more in the mind,* And that is where the art of medicine comes in. Sometimes you cure and you heal. Sometimes you cannot cure, but you can heal to some extent. Sometimes you can heal when there is no real physical illness to cure.

*What’s the missing link in medicine today?*

Medicine has lost its path because it’s so enamoured of machines and technology. The doctor relates more often to these than to the patient. He’s making his diagnosis in the laboratory rather than at the bedside.

*So, is the famed ‘bedside manner’ now on life support ?*

Not yet, but it’s really neglected. Lack of empathy is the one reason for the decline in medicine. *Only when a patient is listened to at length,* and examined carefully, can there be the doctor-patient bond which lies at the core of medicine. This is particularly so in a very sick patient, who almost has an antenna which senses genuine empathy. When that happens, there is faith, and it’s amazing *how much faith can heal*. Empathy can make the difference between life and death. He feels _‘My doctor says I’m going to get well, I believe in him, and I will get well’, and that influences the body._ No one knows exactly how, but it does.

*We can’t wish away technology.*

No, but we have to keeping stressing that there’s another, older side to medicine. After all, can science and technology ever be able to take a good history from a patient? Or take the place of a good physical examination? *No! It’s important to realise that your eyes, ears and hands can sometimes detect what no technology can.*

*Tell us more about deploying all five senses. You wrote about listening to ‘recognise the blowing diastolic murmur of aortic incompetence’.*

You’d miss the diagnosis of very early Parkinson’s, if you didn’t look at a patient’s face, or notice the way he walked into the room. Or a child with high fever may have just a few purpuric spots, blood spots, which could point to a serious illness.

In complicated cases, we need a GP to point to the right specialisation. But the species is almost extinct. *Today’s GP writes out a prescription even before you’ve finished describing your symptoms.*

Sadly, true. The old-school GP asked probing questions, looked at you, listened, stood by you. When specialisation started, those great individuals were great general physicians too, well-versed in the whole gamut of diseases. Medicine has become compartmentalised, that’s the sadness of it. The heart specialist looks only at the heart. He doesn’t factor in the body in which it resides. It’s important for a specialist to be aware that beside the brain, heart, kidneys and lungs, there’s a human being. You can’t treat merely the organ.

*What are the lacunae in today’s teaching?*

Inevitably, there’s more to learn, so much more time must be spent in classrooms. Genetics is an important allied science now. Biochemistry and biophysics. So there’s little time left to spend with patients. As students, we learnt most in the wards.

*How does the ward teach more than the classroom?*

Medicine is learnt at the bedside, never from books. You could study a huge medical tome on medicine, and be able to answer everything from it. But would that make you a good doctor? No. Because you have had no contact with the patient. *Every patient is different*. That’s the most important thing. His response to the disease will depend on his genes, constitution, mental state, sense of well-being and strength. Even his geography. Moreover, you need to take a good history astutely because people of different temperaments present their symptoms quite differently. So, many variables have to be taken into consideration. So, that’s why your best teacher is the patient; the more information, the greater your knowledge. Of course, you keep improving as you realise, ‘this is where I went wrong, why I went wrong, what should have been done’.

*In your 2004 convocation address at BHU, why did you include charity among the hallmarks of a great physician?*

There’s a quote: ‘Don’t enter the temple of science with the heart of a moneylender.’

*Tell us more about medical ethics.*

Beneficence is the most important, doing good to the patient. That’s not limited to your medical intervention. It extends to his inner being. That is where humanism comes in. Second is patient autonomy — which often conflicts with beneficence. So good medicine is a balance. A young man comes in with severe pneumonia, blue and breathless. But, because of his fear of hospitals or doctors, he refuses to have the breathing machine he requires urgently. Without it, he’ll die in a short while. I try and explain, but he is adamant. Patient autonomy says he doesn’t want it, but beneficence tells me if I want to do good to this patient, to the point where I might save him, he needs the machine.

*How did you convince him?*

I didn’t. I just asked the doctor to sedate him immediately, intubate and ventilate. He recovered after a fair amount of struggle because we had wasted those precious minutes, by which time he was almost pulseless and pressure-less. He survived. In a critical situation, beneficence prevails.

But when it comes to a chronic patient, say with cancer, and he’s absolutely against chemotherapy, I tell him, I cannot promise that it will cure you, but it will certainly extend your period of quality living. I ask him to think it over, discuss it with others. If he returns as adamant, I will respect that.

*In ethics, you’ve included justice.*

It’s doing the right thing. Sometimes it is not possible to do exactly the right thing. Then you do what is the least wrong. At the JJ we had a tetanus ward with nine beds and two breathing machines. Sometimes five or six people required one simultaneously. Do I give it to those who are most ill? But, how do I know that those less ill today won’t become more ill tomorrow, because this is an acute disease?

*Isn’t tetanus always fatal?*

Even, with very severe tetanus, people can live. We started this ward and we (that is all my boys and girls working round the clock) brought down the mortality from 100 per cent to almost 18-19 per cent.

*In your decades of practice was there a ‘Eureka moment’, an epiphany?*

All I can say is that you are often taken by surprise. You’re thinking along a certain line, and you find you were wrong. But the important thing is that you must admit it. I’d tell my students at JJ, _‘After you’ve written the patient’s history and the findings from your examination, add what you think is wrong with him: One. Two. Three. So, when all the tests have been done, and it turns out different, you can’t fool yourself’. If you don’t admit it, you’ll never learn._

*Is death the ultimate mocker of medicine’s hubris?*

No. Is there any other certainty in life? *Death is the only certainty.* So you have to take it axiomatically. Unfortunately, modern medicine, very often, wants to fight death to the very last. *Ivan Illich*, a professor of sociology in Mexico, wrote a fantastic book,  *Medical Nemesis* I made it compulsory reading for my registrars at JJ.

*But isn’t it tempting to play God?*

Oh no. If you do, you never know where to draw the line. You must do whatever you can within the realms of reason; that comes with experience. You do not want to prolong the act of dying, but neither can you can you write off the very ill patient. The more you live as a doctor, the more you realise that people you thought were going to die sometimes get up and walk out of the hospital, and the one you thought was almost certainly going to live, doesn’t. That’s the uncertainty of life, and the uncertainty of medicine too.

*Your views on euthanasia are conservative.*

Active euthanasia — giving something to a sick patient with the express purpose of killing him — is to me morally wrong. Respect for life is our basic tenet. A great man was trying to sum up the essence of a doctor’s ethics. Then one day he chanced upon a beautiful sunset. He wrote, ‘Suddenly the words I was struggling for struck me. They were ‘reverence for life’. That was Albert Schweitzer, a great, great doctor who spent his life in an African village looking after really ill people, with very little equipment. He said, if you have reverence for life, then you’re good, kind, truthful; you have empathy.

*Is your most difficult moment telling a patient that there’s no hope?*

You don’t ever say that, not in India. Even if he’s dying, he will not want to talk of it. And, I personally don’t see the point of it. A patient feels, ‘I know my illness has reached a stage where I’m going to die but I just might live a little longer than everyone thinks.’ Why should I extinguish that faint glimmer of hope? Of course, I’ll tell the whole truth to the relatives.

But, a very few patients have discussed this at length with me once they know the end is at hand, and it is a fascinating what they feel, and say. They ask questions, to many of which you have no answers. But whatever you reply must be something that uplifts them, never disturbing.To ‘What is there after death’, I’d rather say ‘It will be better than what is here in life’. And that’s what I honestly feel.

*You believe in a life after death?*

I do. No one has come back from the dead and told us about it, unfortunately. But for me it’s a deep belief. That there’s some other power who’s perhaps directing us. And that power will continue after death.

1. Results not out yet. Let the counting be over

2. EC official has asked media to leave the counting centre. Suspicious behaviour in my
View. Will the results shift

3. Margin is not
Large. If
Modi had campaigned could it have shifted

4. BSP is not
Standing. Had it
Stood would result have been different

5. A little birdie has told me that it is much harder to manipulate EVMs in by elections. Too many eyes on too few machines

For al these reasons I do not believe this should be taken as an indicator of the 2019 result

He notices that the Pope is working his way through the puzzle, and is tapping his pencil, thinking. The Pope turns to him and says, “I usually don’t talk to anyone on flights, but I wonder if you can help me?”

“Anything your Eminence. What is it?”

“Do you know a four letter word that ends in ‘u-n-t’ that means something associated with women?”

Anyone who enjoyed George Carlin will enjoy this!  English language isn't the easiest language to figure out. 
 
 
The English Plural
According to....

We'll begin with a box, and the plural is boxes,
But the plural of ox becomes oxen, not oxes.
One fowl is a goose, but two are called geese,
Yet the plural of moose should never be meese.
You may find a lone mouse or a nest full of mice,
Yet the plural of house is houses, not hice.

If the plural of man is always called men,
Why shouldn't the plural of pan be called pen?
If I speak of my foot and show you my feet,
And I give you a boot, would a pair be called beet?
If one is a tooth and a whole set are teeth,
Why shouldn't the plural of booth be called beeth?

Then one may be that, and three would be those,
Yet hat in the plural would never be hose,
And the plural of cat is cats, not cose.
We speak of a brother and also of brethren,
But though we say mother, we never say methren.
Then the masculine pronouns are he, his and him,
But imagine the feminine: she, shis and shim!

Let's face it - English is a crazy language. 
There is no egg in eggplant nor ham in hamburger; 
Neither apple nor pine in pineapple. 
English muffins weren't invented in England.

We take English  for granted, but if we explore its paradoxes,
We find that quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square, 
And a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig.
And why is it that writers write, but fingers don't fing, 
Grocers don't groce and hammers don't ham?

Doesn't it seem crazy that you can make amends but not one amend?
If you have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of all but one of them,
What do you call it?

If teachers taught, why didn't preachers praught? 
If a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat?

Sometimes I think all the folks who grew up speakingEnglish
Should be committed to an asylum for the verbally insane.
In what other language do people recite at a play and play at a recital?

We ship by truck but send cargo by ship...
We have noses that run and feet that smell.
We park in a driveway and drive in a parkway.
And how can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same,
While a wise man and a wise guy are opposites?
 
You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language
In which your house can burn up as it burns down,
In which you fill in a form by filling it out,
And in which an alarm goes off by going on.
 
And in closing..........

If Father is Pop, how come Mother's not Mop?

[3/17/18, 10:30:04 AM] Kavi: I suppose the "logical conclusion" you refer to is splitting of the country in multiple squabbling states. Without even resorting to futuristic thinking, even with how the world has shaped up as of today, small states are simply unviable, so it's absurd for people to start dreaming about little states living in hostile proximity to each other. Merely the defense and immigration control budgets would kill off most of them (leading to another messy consolidation ...). Then there are matters of food security, water, technology research & development, which boggle the mind. 

Perhaps the real issue is states rights, esp. control over water resources. It would be more sensible to steer the discussion toward this constitutionally enshrined topic.

[3/17/18, 11:38:37 AM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: It’s safe to say that Stephen Hawking wasn’t the perpetually offended type – in fact, his own bleak sense of humour beat anyone else to the punch

One BBC staffer reports that on Newsnight, a producer pulled out a cable – and Hawking slumped forwards as if he had been ‘disconnected’. When producers ran up to him, Hawking was already chuckling to himself.


He also famously said in an interview, ‘The downside of my celebrity is that I cannot go anywhere in the world without being recognised. ‘It is not enough for me to wear dark sunglasses and a wig. The wheelchair gives me away.’

In a 2012 biography, ‘Stephen Hawking: An Unfettered Mind’ Kitty Ferguson claimed that the physicist would deliberately run over people’s toes in his wheelchair if they annoyed him. Ferguson wrote, ‘The prince was intrigued by Hawking’s wheelchair, and Hawking, twirling it around to demonstrate its capabilities, carelessly ran over Prince Charles’s toes. ‘People who annoyed him, it was said, found themselves a target.’

During an appearance in Tonight with Jon Oliver, the host asked Hawking: ‘You have stated that you believe that there could be an infinite of parallel universes. Does that mean there is a universe out there where I am smarter than you?’ To which, Prof Hawking hit back: ‘Yes. And also a universe where you are funny.’

Hawking’s acerbic sense of humour was also turned on helpless victims such as Theresa May. At an event, he said, ‘Thank you Prime Minister for those very kind words. I deal with tough mathematical questions every day, but please don’t ask me to help with Brexit.’

And Vijay Sharma has a similar structure in India since RBI requires payment banks to be controlled by an Indian - economics are passed onto Alibaba invested PayTM. Ultimately, “control” in these businesses come from the ability of the founders to deliver.

[3/17/18, 8:41:50 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: I believe this was taken during his interview with Modiji.  Where all he did was admiring Mr. Modiji’s persona. And counting the amount in his mind.

[3/17/18, 10:46:25 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: Now it’s 11-5
[3/17/18, 10:46:44 PM] ‪+91 98103 60586‬: She should be able to win the first game, unsettling Yamaguchi with attack
[3/17/18, 10:46:45 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Sindhu and Gopi talking in Telugu only. Nice

[3/17/18, 10:51:09 PM] Shumone: Net play is seeming to be a challenge...
[3/17/18, 10:51:16 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Sindhu looks slimmer this time. Am I right MLN? Is that losing extra weight giving more agility?
[3/17/18, 10:51:24 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: She is mixing it up well today
[3/17/18, 10:51:28 PM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: 🙏🏽🙏🏽 Thanks da MLN
[3/17/18, 10:51:30 PM] Shumone: Briliant bet shot just now!!

[3/17/18, 10:52:16 PM] Shumone: Great shot Y.

[3/17/18, 10:52:50 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: Usually Sindhu tends to let the opponent in at this stage
[3/17/18, 10:52:51 PM] Shumone: Oops! 17-12
[3/17/18, 10:53:17 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: What is bet shot?

[3/17/18, 10:56:27 PM] Sridhar Mudan: Your reading is so accurate 😣
[3/17/18, 10:56:36 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Not for nothing why yamaguchi is considered great! She is  pushing Sindhu very very hard...
[3/17/18, 10:56:40 PM] ‪+91 98203 49558‬: 17-17
[3/17/18, 10:57:19 PM] ‪+91 98103 60586‬: 19-17
[3/17/18, 10:57:38 PM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: Close

[3/17/18, 10:58:51 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: She is losing the intensity
[3/17/18, 10:59:24 PM] Sridhar Mudan: Prasad.. Do something
[3/17/18, 10:59:37 PM] ‪+91 99204 16330‬: Done
[3/17/18, 10:59:38 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: She won
[3/17/18, 10:59:39 PM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: Yesssss
[3/17/18, 10:59:44 PM] ‪+91 98103 60586‬: First game to Sindhu
[3/17/18, 11:00:13 PM] Shumone: and what a shot to finish the match!!! Yay Sindhu!!!
[3/17/18, 11:00:16 PM] Nikesh: Yup. This game is done.
[3/17/18, 11:00:35 PM] Nikesh: Still not fluent it seems....
[3/17/18, 11:00:36 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: But very close
[3/17/18, 11:00:55 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: If you hear words like “ vadalaku”, pattuko, kottu it’s us cheering her
[3/17/18, 11:01:01 PM] ‪+91 98103 60586‬: I think Sindhu wins in two, Yamaguchi wins in three. Yamahuchi has too much of momentum.
[3/17/18, 11:01:45 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: It’s not over yet. Expecting a tight second game. Sometimes Sindhu gets blanked out for 4/5 points in a row.
[3/17/18, 11:01:51 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Yamaguchi doesn't seem  to be tired unlike sindhu
[3/17/18, 11:03:02 PM] ‪+91 98103 60586‬: 2nd point 2nd game like 1st point 1st game.
[3/17/18, 11:04:32 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: Sindhu has to push her to the back of the court as Yamaguchi is strong at net
[3/17/18, 11:04:54 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: I am also thinking the same
[3/17/18, 11:05:40 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: But yamaguchi is drawing her to the next again and again
[3/17/18, 11:07:01 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Sindhu is looking really tired. Is that right MLN?
[3/17/18, 11:07:42 PM] ‪+91 98103 60586‬: 5-5, lucky net cord. Tired does not matter, she has enormous will
[3/17/18, 11:08:51 PM] ‪+91 99204 16330‬: Yamaguchis errors keeping Sindhu in the game
[3/17/18, 11:08:56 PM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: Even
[3/17/18, 11:09:56 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Very true
[3/17/18, 11:10:24 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: Yanaguchi is like Aranxta sanchez - a great retriever. She waits for mistakes from her opponent
[3/17/18, 11:11:19 PM] Shumone: Why isn’t Sindhu converting the smashes?
[3/17/18, 11:12:43 PM] Shumone: Y is smashing much better..sharper, harder and into open spaces. Has Gopi Sir asked her to restrain from smashing?
[3/17/18, 11:12:50 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: She is holding herself back in the fear of making mistakes or sometimes she just forgets her strategy
[3/17/18, 11:13:43 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Oh...
[3/17/18, 11:13:48 PM] ‪+91 99204 16330‬: 9-12
[3/17/18, 11:14:32 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: Beat her at her own game - at the net
[3/17/18, 11:14:33 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: I like Y's confidence
[3/17/18, 11:14:34 PM] ‪+91 95940 31317‬: There's a smash!
[3/17/18, 11:14:54 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: After a long time
[3/17/18, 11:15:17 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Second one !
[3/17/18, 11:15:19 PM] ‪+91 95940 31317‬: And another
[3/17/18, 11:15:21 PM] ‪+971 52 645 9266‬: Yesss

[3/17/18, 11:17:00 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Come on Sindhu
[3/17/18, 11:17:11 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: Might go to to the decider unless Sindhu stops making unforced errors
[3/17/18, 11:17:54 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: only good thing is that she is not letting Yanaguchi run away won’t the game so far
[3/17/18, 11:17:58 PM] Alok Gupta: I think Sindhu has picked up over the last few points
[3/17/18, 11:18:57 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Hard luck
[3/17/18, 11:19:04 PM] ‪+91 99204 16330‬: What a point, but still 13-15
[3/17/18, 11:19:05 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: What a rally
[3/17/18, 11:19:28 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: Sindhu has also has this tendency to attract warnings from the umpires
[3/17/18, 11:19:50 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: She is definitely tired
[3/17/18, 11:20:01 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Slipping away....nooooo
[3/17/18, 11:20:19 PM] Alok Gupta: Still only two points ahead
[3/17/18, 11:20:39 PM] ‪+91 95940 31317‬: Ouch :(

[3/17/18, 11:21:36 PM] Alok Gupta: Nice
[3/17/18, 11:22:01 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: I think her lack of energy Costing her dearly..comparatively speaking
[3/17/18, 11:22:41 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Four points diff.very tough
[3/17/18, 11:22:47 PM] Alok Gupta: Nice
[3/17/18, 11:22:54 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Come on Sindhu

[3/17/18, 11:28:41 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: Sending her mom to back rows..hopefully she will the decider
[3/17/18, 11:29:01 PM] Shumone: Lol!! It worked last time!!
[3/17/18, 11:29:05 PM] ‪+91 98103 60586‬: 3 great lifts by Sindhu in the longest point of the match. Sindhu does play the end game with great determination.
[3/17/18, 11:29:08 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: Sachit/ Vivek/ Sriram should know
[3/17/18, 11:29:17 PM] Alok Gupta: Sriram

[3/17/18, 11:37:52 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Always rallys are won by Y
[3/17/18, 11:38:08 PM] Shumone: Some brilliant baddie being played! A treat to watch!

[3/17/18, 11:41:28 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: Last rally worn by Sindhu. A good sign. He waited for her chance which is not Sindhu’s forte
[3/17/18, 11:41:40 PM] Shumone: Apparently!!!
[3/17/18, 11:41:44 PM] Nikesh: MLN does some black magic

[3/17/18, 11:43:23 PM] Alok Gupta: Y is tired
[3/17/18, 11:43:29 PM] ‪+91 99204 16330‬: Yamaguchi tiring more
[3/17/18, 11:44:01 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Sindhu has lifted her fame

[3/17/18, 11:46:53 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: Typical Sindhu - opening doors to her opponent
[3/17/18, 11:47:48 PM] ‪+91 98103 60586‬: 14-11
[3/17/18, 11:48:04 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: But Yanaguchi is a great retriever. Gotta Give it to her

[3/17/18, 11:50:31 PM] ‪+91 98206 96646‬: She wears her expressions on her face easily. Yama is tired too. Just doesn't sho it.
[3/17/18, 11:51:31 PM] Alok Gupta: Nice
[3/17/18, 11:51:38 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Little luck there

[3/17/18, 11:52:53 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: Ominous signs..
[3/17/18, 11:53:22 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: The diff.is the stamina
[3/17/18, 11:54:02 PM] ‪+91 98206 96646‬: No dìff. Yama is dead beat too
[3/17/18, 11:54:04 PM] ‪+91 98103 60586‬: 17-16
[3/17/18, 11:55:02 PM] ‪+91 99204 16330‬: What a mias
[3/17/18, 11:55:06 PM] ‪+91 99204 16330‬: Miss
[3/17/18, 11:55:13 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: 17-17
[3/17/18, 11:55:29 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: But Sindhu can hold her nerves
[3/17/18, 11:55:44 PM] ‪+91 98206 96646‬: Got her
[3/17/18, 11:56:03 PM] ‪+91 99204 16330‬: Just not giving up
[3/17/18, 11:56:07 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: Surprisingly INDIAN supported are muted

[3/17/18, 11:56:51 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: It is quite tense.

[3/17/18, 11:57:36 PM] ‪+91 99204 16330‬: Bad luck
[3/17/18, 11:57:40 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: She does it often at crucial points..
[3/17/18, 11:57:55 PM] ‪+91 98103 60586‬: 18-19
[3/17/18, 11:57:56 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: I think she challenged in order to get a rest
[3/17/18, 11:58:18 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Now it is a real test of character
[3/17/18, 11:58:42 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Good fight
[3/17/18, 11:58:46 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Bad kick

[3/17/18, 11:59:26 PM] Nikesh: Worth watching
[3/17/18, 11:59:27 PM] Shumone: What a match! Can’t feel back having lost to Y!!
[3/17/18, 11:59:39 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Yes.
[3/18/18, 12:00:33 AM] ‪+91 99204 16330‬: Should have won from 11-7 , she lost it letting the lead go
[3/18/18, 12:00:33 AM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: When is the next tournament?
[3/18/18, 12:00:35 AM] ‪+91 94267 00946‬: Fantastic game.
[3/18/18, 12:01:00 AM] ‪+91 99204 16330‬: She let's up when ahead if one were t be critical
[3/18/18, 12:01:38 AM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Good game. Both are equally good. But stamina is always with Y and a shade better game
[3/18/18, 12:01:47 AM] ‪+91 99204 16330‬: Has good mental strength when behind but sometimes loses focus when ahead
[3/18/18, 12:02:14 AM] ‪+91 99204 16330‬: Am sure the coach is well aware of this
[3/18/18, 12:02:32 AM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: Yes she does lose her focus . That’s Gopi’s frustration too . You can’t afford that in big matches
[3/18/18, 12:02:41 AM] ‪+91 98103 60586‬: Good point Anandh.
[3/18/18, 12:02:46 AM] Shumone: Sindhu is one of the best sportspeople in the world! And one of the best India has ever produced!! Three cheers to S!
[3/18/18, 12:02:49 AM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: She feels contented when a few points ahead..looks like..
[3/18/18, 12:03:09 AM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Very Very  true!
[3/18/18, 12:03:24 AM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: How old is She? 25 ?
[3/18/18, 12:03:45 AM] ‪+91 99204 16330‬: With her game and mental strength she is capable of domination. She is still 22, so still can look forward
[3/18/18, 12:04:24 AM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Only 22, hope to see her atleast for another 5-6 years.
[3/18/18, 12:05:19 AM] ‪+91 98103 60586‬: We have just seen the 2nd Indian woman semi-finalist at All England. For all Indians, Sindhu is to be enormously proud of. Without doubt, Gopichand is the greatest Indian sportsperson ever.
[3/18/18, 12:06:12 AM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: She has to improve her energy levels. She is no match for Y despite having a good game
[3/18/18, 12:06:28 AM] ‪+91 99204 16330‬: Of course..but yeh Dil maange more
[3/18/18, 12:07:03 AM] ‪+91 98206 96646‬: See what our shooters have achieved. India's demographic dividend is showing up finally. Assisted by the reqyisite coaching and funding!
[3/18/18, 12:07:31 AM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: Sorry guys.
[3/18/18, 12:08:11 AM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: Yep . She is a great champ and ambassador of the nation. She is to mature a little bit more .Now onto Lin Dan show
[3/18/18, 12:08:14 AM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: AC - Pls make a joke about RaGa
[3/18/18, 12:08:20 AM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Better luck next time MLN
[3/18/18, 12:10:06 AM] ‪+91 98103 60586‬: To Judge our shooters, we will get to see their performance at CWG and Asiad this year.
[3/18/18, 12:11:35 AM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: Unfortunately it’s not a spectator sport. It doesn’t generate the kind of admiration sports like baddy and tennis generate. Sindhu and sauna are globally recognised 
Faces where as Abhinav Bindra is not
[3/18/18, 12:11:51 AM] Shumone: Hey, this will make her stronger and even more determined!!
[3/18/18, 12:12:17 AM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: CWG is a waste of time. Should be scrapped . No relevance
[3/18/18, 12:14:10 AM] ‪+91 98103 60586‬: Well, this one is Wimbledon. Shooting has eight to ten world cups in a year. So we do not know how good the recent medals are. If we were to win 5 golds at Asian Games that would be some achievement.
[3/18/18, 12:17:14 AM] ‪+91 98103 60586‬: Keen to have elaboration of your point of view.

[3/18/18, 1:36:10 AM] Kavi: His worries are correct, and conclusions questionable. He points to manufacturing as a savior in waiting. Yet, while he is willing to vilify AI as the predator of services employment, he turns a blind eye toward 3D printing as the equivalent for manufacturing (and construction too in fact ...)

I wonder why it is suddenly fashionable to bash AI but not 3D printing ...
[3/18/18, 1:58:54 AM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): Perhaps he sees 3d as a function of AI?
[3/18/18, 2:01:38 AM] Vasu: Krugman's stock is down these days. He got it all wrong on post-Trump markets performance and Trumpy nominated him for his 'Fake News Awards'
[3/18/18, 2:15:45 AM] Kavi: That’s simply not true. 3D printing, in its current form, is simply classical Computer graphics code driving the placement of material instead of pixels. AI is a conpletely different subject
[3/18/18, 2:16:37 AM] Kavi: Mr trump’s evaluation is not exactly a “credible source”!

The group was busy
[3/18/18, 8:57:04 AM] Rajesh Singh: Hey guys, missed the live telecast last evening. But the live commentary on this group took me through all the ups and downs of the exciting match with analysis thrown in. As good as watching live with a panel of experts! The newspaper report was not even a patch on this group's posts!
[3/18/18, 9:26:57 AM] Shumone: And you had MLN sharing his thoughts and some significant game plans (incl. moving PVS’s Mom to the back row) live!! This was amazing! And finally the winner was the game of badminton. And we celebrated their unbelievable tenacity,  positive spirit, never say die attitude and setting a new bar on physical fitness. Have not seen too many matches which were as keenly fought as this! MLN and Atul - you deserve a standing ovation for playing a lead role in transforming a non-cricket sport in India and creating phenomenal sport stars for this and the generations to come!! Can’t remember sitting as glued as this except in an Indo-Pak match (only to know later that it was probably fixed) or a World Cup soccer match.

[3/18/18, 10:33:47 AM] Kavi: Some basic google searches turn this up to be a fake news incident from 2013! 

The headline appears to have had been challenged as misleading and sensational and subsequently corrected:

[3/18/18, 10:47:47 AM] Venkatesh Kini: I spent a day hosting Krugman when he came to India for the ET global summit some years ago.  Took him around delhi in my car and showed him various sights. I was not impressed. He may be a brilliant economist and a well known writer but was full of himself and is not a very nice guy.
[3/18/18, 10:48:13 AM] Venkatesh Kini: He has definitely missed the mark on predictions for the USA economy
[3/18/18, 12:46:17 PM] Kavi: i am waiting to get a chance to hear some of the incidents you allude to with mr krugman in your interactions. I will supply the necessary liquid ingredients to get the information flowing :)
[3/18/18, 12:47:00 PM] Shumone: Kini, any plans for the NCR?
[3/18/18, 12:51:53 PM] ‪+91 99908 90099‬: Btw, Krugman, in his pre Noble avataar, was our Prof ( International Trade ) in 2006-07 in WWS, Princeton when he was just a NYT columnist and a boring prof .. we have had number of sittings arguing his theories ... he argued while we enjoyed draught beer 🍺
[3/18/18, 12:52:27 PM] Kavi: kini has hinted at plans to breeze thru NCR on his world tour at some point, hence my offer. We should get a session with him when he graces the area with his presence :)
[3/18/18, 12:53:17 PM] Kavi: those are the absolutely best exchanges of information :)
[3/18/18, 12:54:27 PM] Shumone: For sure!! Looking forward! Our next Ted Talk is due.
[3/18/18, 12:54:59 PM] Vasu: This is perhaps right-wing drivel but suggests Krugman certainly evokes strong opinion

Those passing through Mumbai and can adjust their schedule . Welcome... ☺
the only rider is next Sunday is Ram Navami.. a dry day 😶

[3/19/18, 6:36:55 AM] Kavi: fake site ?
[3/19/18, 6:38:07 AM] Arvind Sahay: There was some web site apparently claiming to be Hawking related where this claim exists.
[3/19/18, 6:41:19 AM] Kavi: ok well, if US can have creationist in the Senate/Presidency, India can certainly have its own flavor of WTF in high places. I just hope this stuff does *not* show up in science textboooks

[3/19/18, 9:06:14 AM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: Exactly. As minister u need to talk at so many forums thoda ho jata hai. No big deal. When Armstrong walked on moon did he prove iIslam as false faith?

[3/19/18, 11:13:50 AM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: What is really worrying me is, (of all the people) Arnab giving up on Modi & co for the second term.  Generally his prediction comes true. Oh..god...one more term for Congi, false histories again will do the round, more scams, again minority appeasement, loss of pride at global level, goonda Raj in many states, high level of No.2 businesses, less tax compliance, high fiscal deficit due to freebies, high inflation,  more farmer suicides, more free-for-all, undoing of all good efforts of this Govt., possible dilution of GST  (which has started giving results as expected), high handedness of ministers, horse trading, poor law and order situation, etc...and finally the ig bang return of Burkha😩😩  and other cronies  like  sagarika, rajdeep....ominous !

[3/19/18, 12:01:23 PM] ‪+91 94267 00946‬: I was an advisor for an aluminum foil plant till 3 years ago. parekh aluminum was a major competition. Everyone in the market knew they were running a sham business. Wonder why it has taken so long to register a case.
[3/19/18, 12:04:26 PM] ‪+91 94267 00946‬: My clinents became a sick unit. One major reason was that they kept loosing orders to Parekh. They were never able to match the trickery and underhand tactics of this particular player. Parekh would over invoice and under invoice as per needs of buyer. Sell in cash if needed. They were the Masters of the game. 

And everyone knew except the bankers
[3/19/18, 12:13:48 PM] Alok Gupta: The bankers probably know. All 22 of them. Normally you are supposed to inform your main banker before getting limits from other banks
[3/19/18, 12:17:14 PM] ‪+91 99000 94149‬: All bankers would know 
Despite that he was allowed to carry on
[3/19/18, 12:17:40 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: I always wonder how people cheat  consortium of banks. Either all banks are equally inefficient with weak procedures or all banks have corrupt people who beat the system in collusion with immoral business people.
[3/19/18, 12:31:26 PM] Alok Gupta: The is no either. Banks are in collusion
[3/19/18, 12:32:57 PM] ‪+91 98408 56130‬: Good point MSR
[3/19/18, 12:37:59 PM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: All banks delegate decision taking to lead bank. CMD n ED come under finmin pressure who provide posting n promotion. RBI is helpless in this.
[3/19/18, 12:40:33 PM] VMK: And there are middlemen who help unscrupulous businessmen secure loans through fabricated documents by bribing bankers. And influential senior govt officials who ensure banks do their friends and relatives a favour. And you have ministers who organise loan melas and distribute public money which will never come back. And there are other ministers who say it is ok if borrowers of a particular religion don’t pay back loans. So overall a totally screwed up place.
[3/19/18, 12:40:45 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: I thin Alok's answers that well. "Banks are in collision"
[3/19/18, 12:45:29 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: That means that well educated, upwardly mobile who are supposed to have come from middle & upper middle class people and who are supposed to uphold principles and honesty are faltering clearly. Why these good people are going corrupt?  Was their upbringing to be blamed ? Or their education? Or their weak morale and morality? What right these group of people have to blame politicians ?
[3/19/18, 12:47:51 PM] ‪+91 98103 60586‬: We all love to see honesty in others. We absolutely hate to see dishonesty in others. We love a leader who is making examples of other dishonest people.
[3/19/18, 12:48:40 PM] ‪+91 94267 00946‬: I can share my experience. The unit was becoming sick. Huge working capital losses. Accumulated losses of about 30 cr. We went to meet the bankers. Wanted to pay principal of about 20-22 cr and get waiver of interest and penalties of 7-8 cr and settle the account and close the unit. 

They asked "kyun shut down karna hai". We explained the working capital issue. I made the presentation. We also mentioned parekh and the unethical practices and how some bankers were common. 

We came back with a working capital limit of 40cr. 

Finally the unit went under with a loss of 70cr. 

Negotiation going on for one time settlement etc. I am now out of the picture, so don't have latest details.

But I am sure no money was paid for WC limit of 40cr.

Infact we had a WC limit of 10cr from a nbfc for which a bribe was paid.

CII is an Association of the Rich and Powerful
[3/19/18, 2:51:53 PM] VMK: Nirav Modi, who carried out the biggest theft of India, shares the same name as our Prime Minister. The most corrupt man in cricket also shares the same name. So what does Modi actually mean? It symbolises the collusion between India's biggest crony capitalists & PM: Rahul Gandhi
[3/19/18, 2:52:43 PM] Nikesh: Oye... There are definitely many other adjectives I would choose... 😀

[3/19/18, 4:48:55 PM] JB Jagdish Bajaj: You mean Dikhawa. & Nautanki. 
That’s his true nature. Witness his fierce Punjab loyalists turn back on him
[3/19/18, 4:49:09 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Now I realise (lately) that there are more anti-Modi  than Modi Bhakts in this group 🤔 😒😒. Can we take this as representative  sample to forecast Modi's downfall ?  I turn to astrologist Sanjiv in the other group...😀
[3/19/18, 4:51:19 PM] Alok Gupta: It is the up math. Up half modi saaf. Even if Modi gets 40 seats In up he is done for.

With bsp sp combo there is a very good possibility of that
[3/19/18, 4:53:01 PM] Alok Gupta: Meanwhile came out of a big lunch adda in  Bangalore including quite a few hard core kannadigas. They think that likely is BJP majority. At worst BJP plus Gowda. Congress has no chance.
[3/19/18, 4:54:06 PM] Sridhar Mudan: But he has been keeping a low profile.. One sees a lot less of rabble rousing and playing to gallery. Not sure if that in anway translated to better governance.
[3/19/18, 4:55:45 PM] VMK: But Siddu’s gambit - recognised Lingayats as separate religion today- might change things quite a bit. Lingayats are 17% of the population in KA. Overall it will be very close.
[3/19/18, 4:59:33 PM] Sachit Jain: Nope. I think it is in the highly educated as this venerable group is, that more and more numbers are anti Modi however in the masses I still believe Modi is still by far the most popular leader and we will still see him as PM in 2019 ( 2018 November?) albeit with a significantly reduced majority
[3/19/18, 5:01:22 PM] JB Jagdish Bajaj: Modi will not be effective as he has been as PM with BJP having 200 seats.
[3/19/18, 5:01:36 PM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): There's a note going around that over 100 journalists have been killed since this govt came to power. Is that fake or true?
[3/19/18, 5:02:38 PM] Sridhar Mudan: Modi bhakts are taken aback by pnb developments. Their silence started then. Losses in UP also a cause for pushing voices deep down. Chacks needs to come out of the puja room.
[3/19/18, 5:03:19 PM] ‪+91 99000 94149‬: 😭
[3/19/18, 5:04:10 PM] ‪+91 99000 94149‬: After May 15, 2018 till end of year 2018 things will work out for Modi very well 
Till then Keep 🤫
[3/19/18, 5:05:55 PM] VMK: I would say critical of Modi than anti-Modi.
[3/19/18, 5:07:24 PM] JB Jagdish Bajaj: Key lies in keeping SP & BSP apart & increasing their Mistrust. Given the margin of victory recently, I think BJP has the edge in LS.
[3/19/18, 5:08:19 PM] VMK: If BJP wins KA, end of story for RaGa. We can expect snap polls along with Rajasthan/ MP in Oct / Nov ‘18
[3/19/18, 5:08:20 PM] Sachit Jain: PNB as I have maintained is a fraud and not a Govt involved scam. Since the Congress doesn’t have anything on the corruption handle to get Modi, they have been making this issue into a political issue. Unlike the NPAs which are in most cases involved large scale political corruption to get undeserved loans and then diversion of those loans to private coffers. The game was to then get the write  offs from the banks and keep the company too. 
Classic case of Heads I win and Tails you lose. 
Unfortunately that cycle has come to an end now!
[3/19/18, 5:08:51 PM] Sachit Jain: I stand corrected
[3/19/18, 5:09:08 PM] Alok Gupta: 100 journalists have not been killed . That is alternative facts
[3/19/18, 5:10:04 PM] JB Jagdish Bajaj: Chotta Modi has potential to stick . It’s sensational . even though no connection.
[3/19/18, 5:30:54 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Thanks God. Some relief.
[3/19/18, 5:32:07 PM] ‪+91 94227 74913‬: Thank God...some relief

[3/19/18, 5:57:48 PM] Kavi: Still ... cute 😀
[3/19/18, 5:58:28 PM] Kavi: In Punjabi, “kudion, akkhan na maro” ha ha
[3/19/18, 6:11:26 PM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: There are so many in India arya samaji to swaminarayan to different vaishnav. Only recognised is sikhs also due to their strong focus on distinct appearance n symbol of veneration to granth sahib. Plain stunt by sidda different flag n diff religion.
[3/19/18, 6:14:54 PM] VMK: Yes, it is purely political stunt. But considering Yediyurappa is himself a Lingayat and has a strong following from this community, it will be interesting to see how BJP responds to this.
[3/19/18, 6:15:58 PM] JB Jagdish Bajaj: Against from my college group. Someone had received this post as early as Feb 04. Looks like someone’s imagination really ran riot. But reading with a pinch of salt.

Extremely Scary & Disturbing - 
A MUST READ 
By Dr G Pradhan

1. REVOLT against Modi
I told you before that 2018 is a bloody year and you will witness what u can never imagine
-What Queen earned in 10 years of UPA, She will invest for Pappu in next one year
The amount is appox 5 to 8% of NDA govt GDP
This revolt was not planned after Budget but a few months back. Appox 4 to 5 months back. But Ahmad Patel is working on it since summer of 2017
-Remember Mamata visiting Uddhave of Shiv Sena few months back? Yes the planning with external partners started from this point. Mamata is the bridge for Sonia.
-You witnessed Uddhav walking out.
5 After Uddhav Mamata bridged with chandrababu naidu. In next few days or maybe week, U will see him revolting against Modi 
-Next would be Akali followed by Nitish and later by Paswan
-They all will ask for bigger pie in seat share and ministries. A big force will be standing against Modi including club 160 members, BJP sitting MP, Non performing MPs and a lady BJP minister in NDA
-Almost 50 BJP sitting MPs are in touch with ahmad patel. These MPs failed to solve people’s problems and will not get tickets in 2019
Huge money offered by Ahmad patel camp along with ticket for 2019 election.
-Ahmad Patel gets JDU on board.
-He Called upon a minister who is head of an Ambedkarite party
Miya Patel camp will offer 50K to 15 Cr to people in BJP IT Cell and top handles to support this revolt against Modi.
Hindu hardliners who tweeted for SAMAJWADI party in UP Election are on our radar. We watching all
- Starting Bihar election Prashant Kishore created 5000+ fake Hindu handles. The number now is appox 7000. These handles will be widely used to provoke people against Modi
-All money is not in monetary form major part is distributed in Latin American shell companies
-A meeting held outside India with these revolting parties top represented. The pan has only one objective. 

NO Modi in 2019.
Sonia & Ahmad Patel plan is simple -Revolt, creat doubt against Modi  via social media through paid HRW. People will vote NOTA and that's Congress win
They tried this trick during Gujarat election and it was quite successful
Ahmad patel tells his men to get some trouble in Maharastra, India's financial capital
My 13 tweets and Ahmad maya & his gang rattled
-U observe one important thing
Pappu is keeping mum
Know why?
-bcoz queen said him that he should stop speaking and rest she will manage
-Inside revolt will shake the confidence of many people inside @BJP4India 
Plus many Advani Era and former Vajpayee govt ministers feeling neglected want to throw Modi &  shah out asap
-some senior ministers are murmuring that it is better to remain in opposition than to tirelessly work under Modi
These leeches were expecting large favours once NDA is back but modi kept a tight eye on them
-U ask any babu in delhi
All want Modi to go
So that Pehle K tareh they can have power & money
-You all think I tweet conspiracy theory. Wait for 2020 and once i stop tweeting or not alive, read tweets again and u will know that I warned you years in advance

[3/19/18, 8:19:56 PM] VMK: The Lingayat minority status announcement by Siddaramaiah could have very interesting consequences:
1. Congress is counting on splitting the Lingayat vote bank of Yediyurappa. Might work, but could also backfire with Hindu vote consolidation in favour of BJP
2. Lingayats are limited to Karnataka mostly. So this move may actually showcase Congress’ open effort to divide Hindu votes and may lead to Hindu vote consolidation in favour of BJP in other parts of India.
[3/19/18, 8:25:20 PM] Sachit Jain: Congress again showing its hypocrisy consistently

[3/19/18, 9:34:18 PM] VMK: Yes, since 1942. But the timing and speed makes it clearly political. The expert panel was constituted in Dec ‘17, and the recommendations came in less than 60 days with no apparent process to determine even what percentage of Lingayats wanted this. And the cabinet approves this in no time. Wonder which other committee in India has worked so fast.

[3/20/18, 7:07:46 AM] VMK: *The Parable of the Baltimore Stockbroker*
Imagine getting a mail from a little known stockbroking firm. The mail predicts that a certain stock will rise this week. You leave the mail aside, as you have seen enough such mails.
_Next week_, the Baltimore Stockbroker mails again, with another tip-this time, of a stock going South. The message turns out right, and you decide to mark the Baltimore Stockbroker as 'not spam'.
_Week Three_. Another hit. And your interest is piqued.
This goes on for ten weeks. Ten accurate predictions from the Baltimore Stockbroker.
You, the guy who recently retired with a substantial gratuity in the bank, are hooked.
_Week eleven_, the Baltimore Stockbroker sends you an offer to invest money with him, for a substantial fee of course. There is the usual caveat of past performances not guaranteeing future success, but the Baltimore Stockbroker nudges you to consider his ten week streak.
You do the math. Every week, the Stockbroker had a 50% chance with his prediction. Either he would be right, or wrong.
Combining the probabilities for ten weeks, the chances of the Baltimore Stockbroker to be right ten weeks in a row work out to.. 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2.....ten times... =1/1024.
You consider. The Baltimore Stockbroker must be onto something. And it would be worthwhile to invest your nest egg with him.
You go in for the offer.

_Things, from the view of the Baltimore Stockbroker, are a bit different._

What he did, was start out with sending 10,240 newsletters!
Of these, 5120 said a stock would go up, and 5120 said otherwise.
The 5120 who got a dud prediction never heard from the Baltimore Stockbroker again.
Week Two, the Baltimore Stockbroker sent 2560 newsletters, and the following week he again halved the number, based on who got his correct prediction.
This way, at the end of week 10, he had ten people, convinced he was a financial genius.
That's.. The power of probabilities, cons, and the impact of mathematics on daily life... Just one aspect!

Brearley caught March bowled one of the fast bowlers . 
He was very much like our own Ashok Mankad son of Vinoo

[3/20/18, 3:41:40 PM] ‪+65 9668 5499‬: “KALLE KALLE” in Punjabi means “Akele Akele” in hindi 😘

I was in Ambala, having this pattal tikki, a tangy, mouthwatering , deep fried, boiled potato snack, served with tamarind sauce, yuummmy, thing served on dried tree leaves, with fistful of spices thrown in.. 

When suddenly I get a big whack on my back, " Kalle, kalle".   I spin around to find Deepak, my childhood friend, smiling with mischief in his eyes. 

" oye, baander nu vi eik layien " hello give this monkey also one   pattal tikki. 

And we got engrossed in our nostalgia of the years spend around the same shop in school uniform. 

Later, I tried to decipher the opening sentence, ‘kalle kalle’. Do we have its equivalent in any other language or culture. Just two words convey so much of love, affection, mischief and yaari, (which can be loosely translated into camaraderie). Do we get the impact similar to this one in so less usage of words .?

I think the richness of Punjabi language is in its enmeshed existence with the ethos of the people and culture. The culture says, you cannot enjoy anything alone. If you are doing so, you are infringing the collective edict of the community. So kalle kalle in a way accuses you of enjoying things which must be shared collectively. Enjoyment is through sharing. This is deeply ingrained in all of us and it reflects in the language. Sharing, of everything, joy, sorrow, happiness and grief. We are taught everything is to be shared it gets double or half based on its bhav, nature. Joy shared is doubled, sorrow is halved. Mischief doubles joy, grief gets halved.. its a very intricate web of emotions and collective existence. 

So enjoy life... but not kalle kalle... ;)

[3/20/18, 6:02:30 PM] Ashok Venkatramani: What happens after death... Garuda Purana

*What Happens After Death ??*

What is death ?
Is there life after death ?
Is death painful?
What happens after death ?
How does rebirth happen ?
Where do we go after death ?

These kind of questions related to the most feared event that ends our life always fill our mind, especially when any of our near or dear ones die.

We feel that suddenly the relationship has broken abruptly and wish there could be a connection again. In this quest, our journey to find answers to the above questions begin …

*So, what happens after death ?*

Death is actually a very interesting process !!

*Disconnection of the earth sole chakras*
Approximately 4-5 hours before death, the earth sole chakras situated below the feet gets detached ... symbolizing disconnection from the earth plane !!

A few hours before an individual dies, their feet turn cold. When the actual time to depart arrives, it is said that Yama, the God of death appears to guide the soul.

*The Astral Cord*

Death severs the astral cord, which is the connection of the soul to the body. Once this cord is cut the soul becomes free of the body and moves up and out of the body.

If the soul is attached to the physical body it occupied for this lifetime, it refuses to leave and tries to get into the body and move it and stay in it. We may observe this as a very subtle or slight movement of the face, hand or leg after the person has died.

The soul is unable to accept that it is dead. There is still a feeling of being alive. Since the astral cord has been severed, the soul cannot stay here and is pushed upwards and out of the body. There is a pull from above ... a magnetic pull to go up.

*End of the physical body*

At this stage the soul hears many voices, all at the same time. These are the thoughts of all the individuals present in the room.

The soul on its part talks to his loved ones like he always did n shouts out "I am not dead" !!

But alas, nobody hears him.

Slowly and steadily the soul realizes that it is dead and there is no way back. At this stage, the soul is floating at approx 12 feet or at the height of the ceiling, seeing and hearing everything happening around.

Generally the soul floats around the body till it is cremated. So, the next time if you see a body being carried for cremation, be informed that the soul is also part of the procession seeing, hearing and witnessing everything and everyone.

*Detachment from the body*

Once the cremation is complete, the soul is convinced that  the main essence of its survival on earth is lost and the body it occupied for so many years has merged into the five elements.

The soul experiences complete freedom, the boundaries it had while being in the body are gone and it can travel anywhere by mere thought.

For 7 days the soul, moves about its places of interest like its favorite joint, morning walk garden, office, etc. If the soul is possessive of his money, it will just stay near his cupboard, or if he is possessive of his children, it will just be in their room, clinging on to them.

By the end of the 7th day, the soul says bye to his family and moves further upwards to the periphery of the earth plane to cross over to the other side.

*The Tunnel*

Its said that there is a big tunnel here which it has to cross before reaching the astral plane. Hence its said that the first 12 days after death are extremely crucial.

We have to carry out the rituals correctly and pray and ask forgiveness from the soul, so that it does not carry negative emotions like hurt, hatred, anger, etc atleast from the near and dear ones.

All the rituals, prayers and positive energy act like food for the soul which will help it in its onward journey. At the end of the tunnel is a huge bright light signifying the entry into the astral world.

*Meeting the Ancestors*

On the 11th n 12th day Hindus conduct homas and prayers and rituals through which the soul is united with its ancestors, close friends, relatives and the guides.

All the passed away ancestors welcome the soul to the upper plane and they greet and hug them exactly like we do here on seeing our family members after a long time.

The soul then along with its guides are taken for a thorough life review of the life just completed on earth in the presence of the *Great Karmic Board.* It is here in the pure light that the whole past life is viewed !!

*Life Review*

There is no judge, there is no God here. The soul judges himself, the way he judged others in his lifetime. He asks for revenge for people who troubled him in that life, he experiences  guilt for all wrongdoings he did to people and asks for self punishment to learn that lesson. Since the soul is not bound by the body and  the ego, the final judgment becomes the basis of the next lifetime.

Based on this, a complete life structure is created by the soul himself, called the blue print. All the incidents to be faced, all problems to be faced, all challenges to be overcome are written in this agreement.

In fact the soul chooses all the minute details like age, person and circumstances for all incidents to be experienced.

Example : An individual had severe headache in his present birth, nothing helped him, no medicines, no way out. In a session of past life regression, he saw himself killing his neighbour in a previous birth by smashing his head with a huge stone.

In the life review, when he saw this he became very guilty and  asked for the same pain to be experienced by him by way of a never ending headache in this life.

*Blue print*

This is the way we judge ourselves and in guilt ask for punishment. The amount of guilt in the soul, decides the severity of the punishment n level of suffering. Hence forgiveness is very vital. We must forgive and seek forgiveness !!

Clear your thoughts and emotions, as we carry them forward to the other side too. Once this review is done and our blue print for the next life is formed, then there is a cooling period.

*The re-birth*

We are born depending on what we have asked for in the agreement. The cooling off period also depends on our urgency to evolve.

We choose our parents and enter the mothers womb either at the time of egg formation or during the 4-5th month or sometimes even at the last moment just before birth.

The universe is so perfect, so beautifully designed that the time and  place of birth constitutes our horoscope, which actually is a blue print of this life. Most of us think that our stars are bad and we are unlucky but in actuality, they just mirror your agreement.

Once we are reborn, for around 40 days the baby remembers its past life and laughs and cries by itself without anyone forcing it to. The memory of the past life is completely cut after this and we experience life as though we did not exist in the past.

*The agreement starts..*

Its here that we are completely in the earth plane and the contract comes into full effect. We then blame God/people for our difficult situations and  curse God for giving us such a difficult life …

So, the next time before pointing to the Divine, understand that our circumstances are just helping us complete and honor our agreement, which is fully and completely written by us. Whatever we have asked for and pre decided is exactly what we receive !!

Friends, relatives, foes, parents, spouses all have been selected by us in the blue print and come in our lives based on this agreement. They are just playing their parts and are merely actors in this film written, produced and directed by us !!

*Do the Dead need healing / prayers / protection ?*

The dead always need serious healing and  prayers for a variety of reasons, the most important one being ... To be free and not earthbound !! ... that is stuck in the earth plane and unable to leave.

There are many reasons for the soul to be earthbound like unfinished business, excessive grief, trauma on death, sudden death, fear of moving on to the astral plane, guilt, one of the most important being improper finishing of last rites and rituals.

The soul feels it needs a little more time to wait and finish before moving on.  This keeps them hovering on the earth plane. But the time is limited and it is very very important that they cross over within 12 days to their astral plane of existence, as the entry to the astral world closes a few days after this.

Earthbound spirits lead a very miserable existence as they are neither in their actual plane nor in a body to lead an earthly life. They may not be negative or harmful but they are stuck and miserable. Hence healing and prayers are of utmost importance during this period so that the departed soul crosses over to the designated astral plane peacefully.

Prayers by the whole family is very vital to help the dead cross over. The protection of the soul to help it reach its destination in the astral world is achieved through prayers.

Please Do Not Take Death Lightly ... Now more than ever most souls are stuck on the earth plane due to lack of belief and family neglect.

Finally, for someone who has lost a near and dear one, don’t feel sad ... We never die, we live on, death does not end anything, it is just a little break before we meet again !!

விளக்கம் :

எல்லா உயிர்ப்பொருள்களையும் தாவரப் பொருள் (அசையாப்பொருள்), சங்கமப்பொருள் (அசையும் பொருள்) என்ற இரு பகுதிகளாகப் பிரிக்கலாம். தாவர வகையுள் கல், புல், பூடு, மரம் என்னும் நான்கும், சங்கம வகையுள் புழு, பாம்பு, பறவை, பல்விருகம், மனிதர், அசுரர், முனிவர், பேய், கணங்கள், தேவர் என்னும் பத்தும் அடங்கும். கல்லுக்கும் உயிர் உண்டு என்பதை இக்காலத்தாரும் உடன்படுவர். ‘மிருகம்’ என்பது ‘விருகம்’ என மருவியது. உயிர், தாவரப் பொருளாயிருந்து அறிவு வளர்ச்சிக்கேற்பச் சங்கமப் பொருள்களில் தேவர் ஈறாக உயர்ந்து பிறவி எடுக்கிறது.

இனி, உயிர்களுக்கு நால்வகைத் தோற்றமும் எழுவகைப் பிறப்பும் நூல்களிற்கூறப்படும். முட்டையிற்பிறப்பன, வேர்வையிற்பிறப்பன, வித்திற்பிறப்பன, கருவிற்பிறப்பன என்பன நான்கு வகைத் தோற்றமாம்; இவை முறையே அண்டசம், சுவேதசம், உற்பிச்சம், சராயுசம் எனப்படும். தாவரம், நீர் வாழ்வன, ஊர்வன, பறவை, விலங்கு, மனிதர், தேவர் என்பன எழுவகைப் பிறப்பாம். இவற்றை,

[3/20/18, 8:51:56 PM] Alok Gupta: Dear chax, how is lingayat a religion
[3/20/18, 9:03:40 PM] ‪+91 99000 94149‬: It is a form of shaivaitism or worship of Lord Shiva 
Basavanna the founder in 12 th century AD drew a certain people away from Rituals , Vedas etc and only preached them on Bhakti and said that Bhakti is enough to reach Lord Shiva . All Lingayats wear a lingam in their Janeu , women in a Mala 
Etc 
Hinduism has many sects and Lingayats or Veerashaivas as they are called is one sect . They are 17 percent of Karnataka population and you don’t find them in numbers in other states . 
This was a very weak ask of Lingayats five years back ( incidentally during the last election in the state ) and was rejected then . Now congress wants to appease them and grant them another religion status 
This is very dangerous . 
This will pave way for Ganapathi worshipped to ask for a separate religion and do on and so forth 
Congress can do anything to get vote and we may see with interest what happens because the head of the Veerashaiva Mata determines who should be given vote . Congress can still lose vote as Yediyurappa is planning a significant benefit for them in the state economy and he belongs to the Lingayat community 
Desperate attempt by Siddaramaiah
[3/20/18, 9:07:27 PM] ‪+91 99204 16330‬: Lingayats run many educational institutions and the minority status means less government interference. Can't see what other benefits they get by being classified as minority.

[3/20/18, 9:15:28 PM] ‪+91 99000 94149‬: Incidentally Dr Kalburgi and Gauri Lankesh were Lingayat community members 
There is also a split within them now gaining momentum with clearly one sect as Veerashaiva ( agama and Vedic literature followers ) 
And Lingayats ( only vachana of Basava followers and adopt Bhakti as their main mode of worship ) 
Elections and Money Can vertically split

[3/21/18, 5:09:40 AM] ‪+65 9668 5499‬: Modi destroying termite ridden old Banyan tree

*Mark Tully on Modi*

Mark Tully the BBC correspondent for India for many decades writes about changes happening in MODI'S regime.
In his Book "No Full Stops in India," while discussing about change writes -
In India change takes a lot more time.The birth will be slow and perhaps painful. I believe it could be the *birth of a new order* which is not held up by the crumbling colonial pillars left behind by the Raj but is *GENUINELY Indian* ; a GC modern order, but *not a slavish imitation* of other modern orders”.
He goes on to say that – “For all its great achievements, the *Nehru dynasty* has stood like a Banyan tree, overshadowing the people and the institutions of India, and all Indians know that nothing grows under the Banyan tree”.
As Mark said , Change will be slow and painful, therefore for someone who doesn’t read and makes judgement based on perception will for quite some time not be able to see the change taking place or will pretend as if nothing is changing.
The way changes are coming in *Railways, Power sector, Defense Production and in governance* and at the same time accompanied by the *resentment of the old forces* indicate that the process of change has begun albeit slowly but firmly and is going to be painful.
Let us not undermine the capabilities of this termite ridden old Banyan tree which will still try its best to stop any one growing to the extent that it may even turn the soil upside down before falling down.
For a year or so we may witness more of Dadris, more of Kaniyahas, more of Owaisi style shouting but finally if the *Society keeps its cool, acts maturely* and continues to perform we will sail through and the old forces will die a natural death.
LET ME ADD to this - every day the new stir media throws in your face is all doctored by *forces who wish to topple Modi Govt as Modi has uprooted them* and they are like fish out of the water.
The time has come to continue to support the man and keep your faith intact and we will see new India for sure - bigger, better, stronger, corruption free , peaceful , prosperous than ever before with people having better quality of life..

*- Mark Tully*.

[3/21/18, 8:23:08 AM] Nikesh: That was an interesting conversation between Harsh Mander and Ramchandra Guha. Liberal thought vs Conservative thought was not in question here. It was the definition of liberal thought that itself was in question. 
Each time we come to grips with these definitions, instead of intellectual inquiry there is shrillness. Part of the liberals have arrogated to themselves the right to define as also to propagate liberal ideas and thoughts. 
Questioning thought, liberal or conservative, is fundamental to our understanding. Harsh Mander was always the one without doubts, Ram Guha in some recent tweets showed the same tilt. This is a decent balancing act. As a nation, we must examine how this country can move forward. Old slogans, old cows however sacred, old ideas, must all be challenged. Our discourse must set forth a new understanding of India, an understanding that is relevant today and perhaps even tomorrow.

[3/21/18, 9:37:50 AM] ‪+91 94310 16537‬: _*Breaking News :*_ 

👉 *Zee News Producer Vishwa Deepak* in his resignation letter discloses how *NEWS CHANNELS and complete media is under Government's control.*

Most important point in the Letter:
*"All news is written by adding a 'Modi angle'? Stories are written keeping in mind how it will benefit the agenda of the Modi government."*

Some highlight's of the letter : 
After May 2014, when Narendra Modi has become the PM, almost *every newsroom of the country has been communalized,* but here, situations are even more catastrophic. I apologise for using such a heavy word. But I have no other word except this. Why is it that all news is written by adding a 'Modi angle'? Stories are written keeping in mind how it will benefit the agenda of the Modi government. *We have seriously started doubting that we are journalists. It feels like we are the spokespersons of the government, or that we are supari killers.* Modi is the PM of our country, and is my PM too. But being a journalist, it is difficult to accept so much Modi devotion. My conscience is starting to rebel against me, it seems like I am sick. *Behind every story there is an agenda, behind every show there is an effort to call the Modi government 'great'.* Wanting to attack the opposition in every argument. No word other than attack or war is acceptable. What is all this? Sometimes I stop and think that I am getting mad. Why are we being made so inferior and immoral? After studying from the country's top media institutions and working at Aaj Tak and BBC, Deutsche Welle (Germany) , the *situation is such that people have started calling me a journalist from 'Chhee News'.* Our integrity is being questioned; who will take the responsibility for all this?
There are so many things to say… *A campaign is being constantly running against Congress Vice President  Rahul Gandhi and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and is still running.* Why?

*The way JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar was framed in the name of "nationalism" and was proved "anti-national" through media trials is a dangerous tendency.* We, as journalists, have a responsibility to ask questions to those in authority... In the history of journalism, whatever positive has been achieved is a result of such questions.

At last a Husband has gathered the courage and taken the time to write down  all of these.

We always hear "the rules" from the Wife's side. 

Now here are the rules from the husband's side.

These are our rules! Please note.. 
These are all numbered "1" because each one is as important as the others !!!

1. Husbands ARE not mind readers.

1. Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think of it that way.

1. Crying is blackmail.

1. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do not work! Neither do Strong hints! Obvious hints never! Our wiring does not take them!!  Just say it!

1. Yes and No are perfectly Acceptable answers to almost every question.

1. Come to us with a problem only If you want help solving it. That's what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.

1. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 Days.

1. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us.

1. If something we said can be interpreted in two ways and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one .

1. You can either ask us to do something Or tell us how you want it done. Not both.

1. If you already know best how to do it, please just do it yourself.

1. When I am seeing tv, please say whatever you have to say during commercials.

1. Christopher Columbus did NOT need directions and neither do we.

1. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings. Peach, for example, is a fruit, not! A color. Like Pumpkin!  We have no idea what mauve or lavender is.

1. If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," We will act like nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle.

1. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, Expect an answer you don't want to hear

1. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as football, cars, bikes or games or page 3 pyts.

1. You have enough clothes.

1. You have too many shoes.

1. U r in shape..... Round IS also a shape!

1. Thank you for reading this. Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch tonight;
But did you know men really don't mind that? It's like camping.

Pass this to as many men as you can - to give them a laugh..

Pass this to as many women too as you can - to give them a rather bigger laugh.

😂😂😜.

It only shows what kind of atmosphere has been created where friends attack each other over ideological differences. I could never understand the reason for such outbursts. May be there is a contest on for “ who’s the most loyal”?

Don't share your daily life on these platforms. These guys have no clue and no control. A dangerous world out there!! FB knows more about you than Aadhar does.

[3/22/18, 8:43:38 AM] Venkatesh Kini: Ultimately proves there’s no free lunch.  Interesting business model by Silicon Valley and the tech plus telecom industry - make global comms and internet cheap and ubiquitous. entice billions of unsuspecting consumers to share their lives on various platforms. And earn billions out of selling their data. Yes it connects the world. But also exacerbates income inequality and opens up serious privacy issues. I am on the fence with Facebook right now.
[3/22/18, 8:52:14 AM] Nikesh: Part of it is scary that some anonymous website knows what I do but I remember in my good il days in Patna... Super Stores knew I loved lactobonbons, my barber knew I liked very short hair, our newspaper vendor gave Indian Nation in the morning and The Times of India by 4 pm. Data was shared by many people. Now it seems to be more centralised. Big deal. Just be careful and make sure your fb password and your bank password is not the same... And always give your birthday on Facebook to be different from your real DOB. Make sure you use a picture of your brother aged 6 as your display pic. Ditto for other programs. Just depend upon whatsapp so that when  that gets hacked you can feel true betrayal, deep and unavenged fear.
[3/22/18, 8:52:23 AM] Kavi: Demands there. I have seen it selling in gena village Noida
[3/22/18, 8:52:29 AM] Kavi: Geja
[3/22/18, 8:56:14 AM] Venkatesh Kini: Good point niks. But your barber and your superstore in Patna did not sell your secrets to make a fortune. And become so powerful that they influenced global events or even local ones at a scary scale
[3/22/18, 8:56:30 AM] Venkatesh Kini: Agreed on the simple precautions
[3/22/18, 8:56:43 AM] Venkatesh Kini: Passwords, photos and birthdays
[3/22/18, 8:57:12 AM] Venkatesh Kini: Or simpler still, opt out of Facebook completely and rely on good ole what’s app to be in touch with people
[3/22/18, 8:59:11 AM] Nikesh: We will reach a point of human contact again. Facebook and whatsapp are essentially enablers, a sort of global phone directory..You can dial Skylab Singh and get him after 1979.

You the consumer, watch a program and the channel makes money by delivering your viewership to advertisers.   Advertsiers infkuence you with messages targeted for you. Influencing a user per-se should not be a problem. Problem with FB was circulation of fake news and manipulated news based on ones specific personal information that was  sold away.

[3/22/18, 11:23:44 AM] Vasu: FB unified the world like nothing else. Some ten years ago it was de rigueur to be on it. Discovering long lost school mates and family was a huge thrill those days. Whatsapp doesn’t offer the same discoverability and in many ways built on the success of FB.

[3/22/18, 11:35:21 AM] Krs Jamwal: 😊
[3/22/18, 11:39:46 AM] VMK: WhatsApp serves a very different purpose compared to FB. WhatsApp was already a big success when FB acquired it. I think they would have grown as large even without FB.
[3/22/18, 11:44:21 AM] Vasu: True but my point is about discoverability. I recall that many school mates were practically lost to the rest of us back in 2008. They were brought back into the mainstream thanks to FB. Whatsapp by itself would not have made that possible.
[3/22/18, 11:57:41 AM] Kavi: heh sure, yes, more apt
[3/22/18, 11:58:22 AM] Kavi: agree, FB discoverability was (and remains?) a huge differentiating feature

[3/22/18, 12:12:30 PM] Venkatesh Kini: Every new technology has huge benefits. Until it gets to a point where excesses start to become costly. Electricity saved whales from being hunted for blubber, cars saved cities from being choked by horse dung and the list goes on. Facebook and other social media have been transformative for society. But need to be recognized for the dangers that they pose due to their new found power and ubiquity. Some regulation is needed. Cars are regulated. So is electricity. Shouldn’t social media also face similar controls?

[3/22/18, 12:51:31 PM] Venkatesh Kini: Regulate what can be done with personal data. And not allow Facebook and it’s ilk to profit from the lack of tech savvy of most of its users. We know enough to manage the privacy settings. Most users are not aware or don’t realize the importance

[3/22/18, 1:32:06 PM] Venkatesh Kini: I just met a firm in Bangalore who showed me what level of personal data they have from Facebook and linked in. I’m seriously spooked. Not sure if it was legit or not, but the fact that they have such access is scary.
[3/22/18, 1:34:08 PM] Venkatesh Kini: Agreed. But then they should be absolutely clear to their users that anything posted on their site is eventually going to be accessible to hackers, legit data mining companies and more. The current approach is to say “we value your privacy” and give users a false sense of complacency
[3/22/18, 1:34:14 PM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): My surprise is your surprise! Why are we suddenly spooked. Thing of any area that's foolproof.
[3/22/18, 1:35:00 PM] Sridhar Mudan: Grammar Raja - I thought oxymorons were two word pairs, like, living dead or original copy.

[3/22/18, 1:35:49 PM] Venkatesh Kini: True. I shouldn’t be, but I’m just emerging from a brick and mortar cocoon and never really gave this stuff much thought. Now waking up. This is probably duh stuff for most of you

Who is more likely to be the liar? Why was he kept in “ protective custody” for 3 years in his own country? To keep him silent? He wants the Govt to keep their promise of getting him a job for staying silent all these years.

[3/22/18, 2:46:47 PM] VMK: What would the govt gain by silencing him or by hiding the fact that 39 were killed by ISIS? If anything, this govt would like to play up ISIS killings and call for tougher action on terror / Pak etc.

[3/22/18, 9:16:10 PM] JB Jagdish Bajaj: Why China and not India?

International Business: Why didn't American companies choose India instead of China for manufacturing products?

- Haosen Cai, Engineer

I’ve come across similar questions from time to time on this very topic and I don’t recall anyone ever pointing out the true reason.

The reason as to why India can’t out perform China in manufacturing is NOT because of infrastructure, it’s NOT because of skilled labors, it’s NOT because of corruption, and it’s also NOT because of “superiority of the Chinese mentality”.

I’d like to answer this question with this noun

Unpredictability

Now repeat after me.

Unpredictability

Unpredictability

Unpredictability

This is the single most powerful noun that’s preventing India from being a manufacturing hub - because doing business in India is so god damn unpredictable, therefore it is impossible to calculate your return on investment when dealing with India.

Bad infrastructure? No problem, that can be factored into shipping cost & delivery time

Lack of experienced labors? No problem, that’ll factor into capital/startup cost

Corruption? No problem, tell me who I need to pay and how much, that’ll become part of operating cost

Lots of paper work? No problem, longer startup time means lower return on investment, but that again, can be calculated, and can be made up with higher profit margin.

You know what the problem with India is?

NOTHING CAN BE CALCULATED

In India:

When a someone says “yes”, you have no idea whether he/she actually meant yes or no.

When a worker say that “I’ll be there in 5 minutes”, you have no idea whether he’s one of those workers who keeps his word, or he’s one of those workers who’ll just show up 4 hours later

When an official approaches you and ask for “expedition fee”, you have no idea how much he’s asking, and how much faster he can expedite, and how many more like him are coming

When you are presented with a pile of paper work, you have no idea whether this is the last pile, or whether there are 20 more piles that’s coming after, and whether you were even given the correct paper works to fill out.

Heck, even if you have someone coming in to help, you have no idea whether he’ll hit a cow on the way here and then forced to wait for another 8 hours for a shaman to show up and complete the ritual.

All that plus the occasional “I refuse to work with people from that caste” plus union strike and power outages makes doing business in India extremely unpredictable.

If you are a business owner, would you buy from someone who sells you the same item with $3, knowing that the goods will likely be delivered on time and to specification, or are you going to buy from someone who sells you for $2, but you have no idea when, or even if you’ll get that item?

Most people would buy it for $3, then just markup the profit.

Business is all about predictability, trying to make money without ability to predict is called gamble, and business owner don’t like to gamble when they could avoid it.

So to wrap this up.

Unpredictability is what’s killing manufacturing in India. Not infrastructure, not mentality, not corruption, not skilled labor.

It’s *UNPREDICTABILITY*, in capitalized bold letters.

[3/23/18, 7:30:38 PM] ‪+91 94267 00946‬: ICICI Bank .........This is an amazing convertibility story – how the rich line-up loans and investments for the spouse of a famous banker, make him the owner of big assets and claim no share in it. Truly, Business made easy. This is the story of Deepak Kochhar’s Renweable Empire, built on ‘unclear’ Mauritius route investments and loans from Dhoot and others. And his family owned Trusts – Pinnacle Energy owns 95 pc of this business, the Mauritian investors have no shareholding. Mr Kocchar is the husband of ICICI Bank MD & CEO, Chanda Kochhar.

Mr Kochhar’s company, NuPower on its website makes the loud and showy statement as such companies usually do, “To contribute to the energy security of India & combat climate change by actively participating towards achieving India’s target of 160 GW of wind & solar power by 2022.” Definitely, Mr Kochhar was liberally secured by the Dhoots and a string of Mauritian investors.

NuPower began its journey in December, 2008 as a 50:50 joint venture company. Called NuPower Renewables Ltd (NRL), this was the venture of Videocon chairman Venugopal Dhoot in his personal capacity with Pacific Capital Services Ltd, owned by members of Kochhar family. Mr Deepak Kochhar had just one share in NRL but soon thereafter Mr Kochhar was issued 19.97 lakh warrants of Rs 10 each at par value. He was to pay Rs 1/share only upfront, the remainder Rs 9/per share was to be paid at the time of conversion of warrants into equity. So, on a payment of Rs 19.97 lakh he became the owner of the company. Such was the talent of Mr Kochhar in preparing DPRs and acquiring assets in slump sale that this arrangement was justified! Then the Dhoots resigned and their employees came in as Additional Directors.

Money was required for the slump acquisitions; it came largely from the Dhoots. Two years later, the ICICI Bank granted Rs 3,250 crore loan to five companies of Videocon group. ICICI’s UK and Canada branches provided a further loan of Rs 660 crore to a Cayman Island based Videocon group’s company Tuskar Overseas Inc which the ED has stated has no bonafide business.

And for expansions, money came in through the Mauritius route as CCPS in several tranches. This was channeled initially through a company called Firstland Holdings Ltd, N.A. and then later the money route was changed to another company named, DH Renewables. All this, the company claims went in as equity for setting up 100.5 MW additional Wind Energy Projects in Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu for which 70 pc debt financing from Banks & FIs was also raised.

Dear Sir,

APPLICATION FOR EMPLOYMENT
I refer to the recent death of the Accountant at your office and hereby apply for the job as a replacement of the dead Accountant.

Each time I apply for employment, I get a reply that there is no vacancy but in this case, I have caught you red handed and you have no excuse because while I was in my hometown for holidays I heard the good news about his death so I quickly rushed back to attend the funeral to be sure that he was truly dead before applying.

Attached to my letter is a copy of my CV and his obituary photograph as proof of vacancy.

You can't lie to me this time. GIVE ME THE JOB! 

                            Thank you.
                            Yours faithfully,
                   Owoeye Micheal Ojo

[3/24/18, 7:56:06 AM] Sachit Jain: 68 Journalists, writers and bureaucrats given 2-5 Lakh/month to write against PM Modi through Cambridge Analytica!


Since the time the Cambridge Analytica controversy got exposed, the Congress has been facing major embarrassment. The major expose on Congress links with the company Cambridge Analytica which is known to steal people’s private information to influence their political choice. This information was out recently after the Facebook banned the access to the company.

Later it was found that Congress had hired this same company for the upcoming 2019 elections. This information was exposed by Republic TV which gathered evidence of 8 top political leaders meeting with Cambridge Analytica Company founders in the year 2017. The documents also showed that an NGO was opened by these political parties through which payments were made to the Cambridge Analytica company. An estimated of Rs 800 Crore is said to be paid by the political party to strategize for the upcoming 2019 elections. Cambridge Analytica is in the eye of a global storm over its alleged data theft and the other means by which it influenced global elections.


This same company was also used by Donald Trump before the American elections to influence the psychological preference of the voters. After it was understood that Facebook was used to breach millions of personal information, the union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad yesterday gave warning to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg of stern action if the allegation is found to be true.

But the other shocking part which has been exposed is that around 68 journalists, writers, bureaucrats and film stars have been hired by Cambridge Analytica company which is paying Rs 2-5 Lakhs/month to write against PM Modi. This news was discussed on Republic TV which said that many journalists names were listed in the disclosed Emails of Cambridge Analytica.

But the Congress denied the charges and shifted the blame on BJP. However, their own Congress member has submitted proof busting the Congress lies. Shehzad Poonawalla, who has been a close associate of Rahul Gandhi and Vadra family said that a man called Amrish Tyagi was working with Ovleno, and was “in touch with Rahul Gandhi and team.” “There is concrete proof that Amrish Tyagi of Ovleno was in touch with Rahul Gandhi and team. There was nothing till now, but today when law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has raised the point, some kind of white-washing is being attempted.”

Amrish Tyagi is none other than the son of JDU leader K C Tyagi’s. And it is found that Congress and JDU had taken the help of Cambridge Analytica during the Bihar elections during 2015. Shehzad Ponawala also disclosed certain Emails which reveals that Amrish Tyagi of Ovleno was in constant touch with both Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi since 2012.

In Sept 2016 Amrish Tyagi of Ovleno was in US - met Cambridge Analytica's Alexander Nix... 

Since 2012 Amrish was in touch with "boss" of INC as per his mail to me

(Shehzad Jai Hind (@Shehzad_Ind) 10:11 AM - Mar 22, 2018)


It is now clear that the Congress has hired this company called Cambridge Analytica in order to influence the voters decision on political affiliations. It is a matter of great concern that a National Party hired a foreign company to breach into the private information of millions of Indians just to win elections jeopardizing the security of people.

The government announced that it will probe the matter and if any party or company was found guilty of breaching personal information of people, they will be subjected to stringent punishment.

[3/24/18, 8:12:59 AM] Rajesh Singh: _A brilliant answer by Bala Senthil Kumar to the question below, as answered at popular Q&A site quora.com. A must read, and to ponder about..._ 

 *What is your view on the saying "Congress has looted India for 70 years?"*

It isn't the looting of wealth that bothers me so much as the sheer fact that the Congress merely replaced the Brits in some ways - they just became masters of the same, broken, weak people, who were simply willing to suck up to authority. Nobody gave India confidence! This is the part that bothers me so much, especially with MK Gandhi's style of 'winning' us freedom by giving the enemy higher moral ground.

So, India has grown up as an apologetic impotent nation, where our children are taught to revere impractical, passive, cowardly notions like non-violence, when everything in nature tells us to fight to survive. Of course I know the philosophy of not fighting because of being strong. But this comes from mastery, not shamelessly bowing to masters!

So, we saw a change of guard. The Brits went, and new masters came in the form of the Congress Party. Hierarchies remained, the class system remained, and subservience remained. Where the heck did all the dynamism go?

Then we were thrown into a socialist mindset, people waiting for alms from government wealth redistribution programs instead of being empowered. We got protectionist policies, that prevented prosperity and competition, throwing us away from a path of a meritocracy. Hindustan Motors was started around the same time as Toyota, and Tata Steel started around the same time as Nippon Steel. Nippon Steel produces around five times as much as Tata Steel without native resources of ore. No need to talk about Hindustan Motors and Toyota. Japan coming out of twin nuclear strikes was devastated way more than India under the Brits. Do we need to compare how different the growth paths of these two nations have been?

Only when thousands died did we start the Green Revolution. Only when China attacked us did we realize we need to become militarily stronger. Only with our backs against the wall, did India liberalize its economy. Under the Congress, every move we have made towards any kind of development has come under inevitable circumstances, with our backs against the wall.

India was never allowed to be truly independent, strong, and proud of its people's full potential. No wonder so many of us left in droves and thrived in various countries elsewhere. This is the loot I would feel most wronged by - denying India its best talents and minds, because we didn't create the conditions for dignified development.

Incredibly, the immense sacrifices of our fighting heroes were also swept aside under this avalanche of worship for Gandhiji. Why? So that the Brits would feel good? The Congress party was reporting to British Intelligence for 5 years after we became an independent country, about Subhash Bose's family's movements. During a criminal probe of the Bofors scandal, the Congress External Affairs minister delivered a letter to a foreign body to deny evidence and cooperation to an Indian investigating agency. Years later, a whole bunch of Congress members and their cronies used the letterhead of the Indian Parliament to petition the USA to not issue a visa to Narendra Modi, the man who would become Prime Minister. It is these bunch of ass lickers that I want to hang or burn over a slow fire.

The Congress has a clear obsession with white people and a need to constantly please them. When Hillary Clinton asked India to wean itself off Iranian oil, the Congress government promptly obliged, even though Iran and India have been close friends for a long time. No surprise then that pasta aunty from Italy is their supremo. Think she would have got the same respect if she had been a Nigerian black woman? I don't think so. That's how deeply ingrained the slave mentality is in the ranks of the Congress.

It is the loot of India's pride, dignity, dynamism and die hard spirit that bothers me much much more than the loot of wealth. This country produced enough wealth to support the British Empire for 200 years. It can easily produce much more to ensure prosperity, health and well being for its own people. This is an abundant, powerful country, that has been prevented from being a developed, forward thinking, awesome nation that could by now have been an example for the world.

If India has been a weak, apologetic nation for so long, it's precisely because of the Congress. Why do we have to put up with these weasels and the fools who are aligning with them? I could even tolerate a ruthless, despotic, dictatorial mindset. It is this slimy, backstabbing, self serving Lutyens mindset that really irks me. I would give anything to destroy this smugness, decimate it, and put it firmly behind us.

The economic loot is nothing compared to this, but we will bloody well make them pay for all of it.

It has now been proven that Indian arm of CA claimed that they were involved in BJP’s mission 272 campaign. It was there on their website and now the
Website has been blocked and they are busy scrubbing the internet to erase their association with BJP. When the BJP spokes persons like Nalin Kohli, Samvid patra being asked if they are going to sue SCL/ Ovleno for making this claim they all mumbled something and the anchors didn’t pursue it. 
In fact this guy called Avinash RAI who is also an local partner of CA/ SCL who worked with Mahesh sharma ( current minister ) clearly mentioned that CA has infiltrated congress in 2014 to sabotage their campaign. So I find this kind of posts outrightly funny. In any case as Nikesh pointed out what is so outrageous about this whole thing. They are doing what channels like Republic , Zee, Times Now are doing openly and making money out of it. 

Looks like all political parties used these blokes and whey they got caught, there is a huge tu tun mein mein March is on. As they say “ hamam mein sab nange hain “‘

[3/24/18, 9:29:21 AM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: One of the interesting and more importantly a relieving development for me is that my wife who is a die hard fan of BJP and Modi ( for very obvious reasons) has started to come around my point of view once in a while . Like this morning she clearly felt that winning the 9th RS seat in UP is driven more by a sense of revenge for Gorakhpur and Phulpur losses and that this win definitely doesn’t make up for those losses as in case of RS elections you can buy MLAs . She agreed that Amit Shah is corrupting the party in his quest for victory at any cost. She feels he is “ congressifying “ BJP which will damage the party in the long run. And she even announced that she will vote for TRS in assembly elections which will be her first vote to a non BJP party in any election. 
So there is silver lining. Others will follow soon. People like me and Bichu have to be “ large raho “

Of course there is noway one can question the integrity of PM. But due to stiff compliance and discloser issues and decision Ownership  expected by this PMO from all officers , many people fear taking important decisions/nobody is willing to stick his neck  out for fear of getting caught if something goes wrong genuinely. Hence most of the decisions PM is Forced To take for himself. This is how Rafale deal was done. Though officers not taking  decision is not good, nobody can pinpoint PM for any wrong doing on Rafale.

[3/24/18, 12:59:50 PM] Sachit Jain: I don’t know enough to comment very knowledgeably but I think a very hypocritical stance by Congress. They attack the BJP for being divisive and go ahead and be even more so themselves. Back to caste and sub castes etc
[3/24/18, 1:01:43 PM] ‪+91 98119 93338‬: Realpolitik thy name is hypocrisy. The BJP trashed GST and aadhar no end.
[3/24/18, 1:02:30 PM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): Many of us have influenced our response given this threat that's been building up in the last 10 years. I really think this group should try and focus more efforts on this.

[3/24/18, 1:03:23 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: So there are two strategies - divide based on religion and try and consolidate as much of the Hindu vote while ensuring the opposition does not unite (BJP strategy)

The other strategy is build Hindu caste coalitions plus getting the minority vote and uniting the non BJP parties (this is the strategy
Of
The non BJP parties)

Israel for obvious reasons. Or any other place
[3/24/18, 1:05:23 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: As an intellectual exercise - let
Is this I this further. What would
The negative
Consequences of any be of declaring the Lingayats as followers of s sepeeate religion
[3/24/18, 1:06:47 PM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: It started long long back by our liberal pm ignoring both patel n ambedkar concerns on appeasement. Hindu personal law in 1950s was rammed thro n opportunity of concurrent  muslim personal law or uniform code missed.
[3/24/18, 1:08:59 PM] Vasu: Stirring a hornets nest. The Kodavas of Coorg are now demanding a separate religion status
[3/24/18, 1:10:14 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: You
Have evidence of this
[3/24/18, 1:10:53 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: So Sachit is Jainism a separate religion frm Hinduism
[3/24/18, 1:11:10 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Kavi is Sikhism a separate religion from Hinduism
[3/24/18, 1:17:56 PM] Kavi: They all suck <tm>
[3/24/18, 1:17:58 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Except in one case you
Discriminate in a violent manner against the other. In the other you
At worst discriminate in a positive manner in favour of some groups
[3/24/18, 1:18:19 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: But is it a different religion from Hinduism
[3/24/18, 1:19:05 PM] Sachit Jain: Jainism is a separate religion
[3/24/18, 1:19:38 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: How divisive
[3/24/18, 1:23:43 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: AC your views on it being a divisive action to regard Jainsim as a religion separate from Hinduism?
[3/24/18, 1:25:00 PM] VMK: All divisiveness cause violence when pushed to a point by politicians. We see caste conflicts more often than religious conflicts on a daily basis.
[3/24/18, 1:25:32 PM] Kavi: The question is bogus. Religion is such an ill defined concept that you can prove almost anything from the Munni jumbo premises
[3/24/18, 1:25:40 PM] Kavi: Jumbo jumbo
[3/24/18, 1:26:03 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Evasive
[3/24/18, 1:26:53 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Except that proactive violence in one case is central to strategy and in other it may be an incidental outcome
[3/24/18, 1:26:57 PM] Kavi: Not really, quite confrontational in fact. I question the definition of ALL religions and the ability to answer these sort of questions
[3/24/18, 1:27:37 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: So you are saying that it is not clear that it is a separate religion
[3/24/18, 1:27:58 PM] Kavi: It is not clear to me what the fxxx a religion is in the first place.
[3/24/18, 1:29:18 PM] Sridhar Mudan: This message is choppy like Arnabs :) or is Arnab posting as sanjeev who follows the illustrious footsteps of MLN who posted as Vinaykumar.
[3/24/18, 1:29:57 PM] Kavi: Just a bunch of beliefs a set of people hold - often to some bitter end
[3/24/18, 1:31:39 PM] Sridhar Mudan: Kavi, you dont have to take every question to root level. Most questions are anyway relevant only at trunk, branch level. When everything coalesces into a point which itself defies defintion how can there be any definition of anything.
[3/24/18, 1:32:25 PM] Kavi: Well you see, I have to, that’s my set of beliefs, ha ha
[3/24/18, 1:33:40 PM] VMK: For every Giriraj Singh there is an Owaisi on the other side. There is no good and bad discrimination.
[3/24/18, 1:34:19 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: https://m.timesofindia.com/city/bhopal/RSS-criticizes-minority-status-to-Jains-Sikhs-and-Buddhists/articleshow/39528702.cms

Seems like Jain’s Buddhists and Sikhs have had Ghar Wapasi done to them
[3/24/18, 1:35:29 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: You don’t know it but you are Hindus - you SOBs
[3/24/18, 1:36:25 PM] Kavi: Assuming anybody knows what “Hindu” means in the first place
[3/24/18, 1:36:26 PM] Rajesh Singh: Not enough Tharooresque
[3/24/18, 1:40:06 PM] Rajesh Singh: http://wap.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/fodder-scam-lalu-prasad-gets-7-yrs-in-jail-in-dumka-treasury-case-updates-118032400183_1.html

Jail is fine but what about recovery of loot...
[3/24/18, 1:41:08 PM] Kavi: Or - for that matter “Sikh”. I won’t speak for other religions because , a) I don’t know b) as I mentioned, beliefs held strongly to bitter ends
[3/24/18, 1:42:36 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Chalo at least you
Know what SOB means. Hindu is someone who attended the college across the road from St. Stephens
[3/24/18, 1:42:47 PM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): Hahahahahahaha
[3/24/18, 1:43:31 PM] Kavi: What is that college? I have no clue
[3/24/18, 1:45:57 PM] VMK: True test of minority religions will be when you withdraw all economic minority benefits and see who wants to be where.
[3/24/18, 1:48:07 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Hindu College
[3/24/18, 1:48:19 PM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): Kini is the one true Hindu in our batch.
[3/24/18, 1:48:22 PM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: Parliament discussion ovjection of hindu groups all are well recorded as hindu civil code was rewritten whether polygamy marriage age daughters right to property etc etc. People also raised why not touch  obscurantism in indian muslims also to address but nehru sidestepped.
[3/24/18, 1:48:55 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: No you said Patel and Ambedkar
[3/24/18, 1:49:52 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: But he too is running away from his roots and has handed
His name to Venky. Venky is a different college. It is in south campus
[3/24/18, 1:50:37 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Changed
[3/24/18, 1:50:49 PM] ‪+91 98336 56340‬: Ambedkars pronouncements on future are well documented. With patels interactions were mostly related to somnath. I think hindu civil code touched after patel death
[3/24/18, 1:51:57 PM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): But seriously?!! Not being much of a Hindu (like Kavi I don't get this religion thing much being a beef eating Brahmin going straight to hell and purgatory!) I thought Jainism , Sikhism etc are  variants of Hinduism as they are not monotheistic ?
[3/24/18, 1:52:38 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Now you are talking like a beef eating RSS ideologue
[3/24/18, 1:53:06 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Better turn vegetarian and stick to beefeater gin. Symbolic
[3/24/18, 1:53:59 PM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): My naive interpretation has been that if you believe that there is only one true Messiah eg Jesus or Allah then you paint yourself into a corner and become a religion. If however you are polytheistic then Hindu😝😝😝
[3/24/18, 1:54:44 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: So Hinduism is not a religion?
[3/24/18, 1:54:54 PM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): It is.
[3/24/18, 1:55:16 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: But in Hinduism there is no one messiah
[3/24/18, 1:55:54 PM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): Yes. Therefore it's what remains different. Ergo a separate religion.
[3/24/18, 1:56:15 PM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): The unpainted canvass that adds to the painting.
[3/24/18, 1:56:22 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: So it is a remainder religion
[3/24/18, 1:56:33 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: The etc.
[3/24/18, 1:56:59 PM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): The accepting religion.
[3/24/18, 1:57:02 PM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): I think.
[3/24/18, 1:57:16 PM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): In its original sense.
[3/24/18, 1:57:22 PM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): Oh the irony!!!
[3/24/18, 1:57:36 PM] VMK: Strictly speaking Hindu is a geographical identity. Sanatana dharma is the religion.
[3/24/18, 1:57:55 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: I think I will request Arnab and Chaks to send across some London based gau rakshaks to Goki’s house
[3/24/18, 1:58:36 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Santana is a rock star
[3/24/18, 1:58:47 PM] Kavi: You see bix, why I questioned if anybody even knows what “Hindu “ means 😇?
[3/24/18, 1:59:23 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: I have a clear definition
[3/24/18, 1:59:26 PM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): Tharoor has tried to explain.
[3/24/18, 1:59:36 PM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): Which is?
[3/24/18, 1:59:44 PM] Kavi: Yeah ?
[3/24/18, 1:59:54 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: If you went to a particular college
[3/24/18, 2:00:00 PM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): Hahahahahahaha
[3/24/18, 2:00:06 PM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): Be serious.
[3/24/18, 2:00:07 PM] Kavi: Oh shut up
[3/24/18, 2:00:59 PM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): My potty is nearly over. I need to know what Hinduism is. The nation needs to know.
[3/24/18, 2:01:16 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: But saying Sikhism and Jainism are religions separate from Hinduism is a divisive and anti national act
[3/24/18, 2:01:39 PM] Kavi: Well why?
[3/24/18, 2:02:02 PM] Kavi: Secular republic, freedom of speech. Remember ?
[3/24/18, 2:02:21 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Because saying Lingayats are followesmof a separate religion is a divisive act
[3/24/18, 2:02:51 PM] Kavi: Ok sure in that bite dividing sense, yes
[3/24/18, 2:03:07 PM] Kavi: But surely not anti national?
[3/24/18, 2:03:18 PM] Kavi: I meant vote dividing sense
[3/24/18, 2:03:35 PM] VMK: Doing it two months before elections, purely for political gains is a divisive act
[3/24/18, 2:03:53 PM] Kavi: Sure. One does whatever works for votes.  Healthy
[3/24/18, 2:04:02 PM] Kavi: The market wants it ...
[3/24/18, 2:04:31 PM] ‪+91 99635 52615‬: It’s anti national because this division has been caused by Congis. If the same was done by BJP ( which they would
Have done if they’re in the same situation) then it would have been a patriotic act
[3/24/18, 2:04:34 PM] Vasu: The 2014 article you posted said the objection raised was for the 'minority' tag.
[3/24/18, 2:04:45 PM] Sanjeev Bikhchandani: Three months would have been alright?
[3/24/18, 2:05:19 PM] Rajesh Singh: More like
NOTA 
Or
Misc
[3/24/18, 2:06:11 PM] Sachit Jain: Jainism doesn’t believe in any God
[3/24/18, 2:06:19 PM] VMK: Siddu thought of it only three months back. Lost a precious month in forming an expert panel and pushing them to give a recommendation he wanted.
[3/24/18, 2:08:05 PM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): Perhaps sometimes it makes sense to define something by what it is not? It makes it no less impt or relevant. My naive view as am no practitioner of religion.
[3/24/18, 2:08:41 PM] VMK: If he really was trying to fulfil the genuine demands of Lingayat groups he would have done it at the beginning of his term.
[3/24/18, 2:08:44 PM] Kavi: You sir, are a quantum state permanently collapsed to 1
[3/24/18, 2:08:54 PM] Vasu: This is from a right wing mouth piece but posting it here as it on topic. This is by a Western ‘Bhakt’
[3/24/18, 2:08:59 PM] Vasu: http://organiser.org//Encyc/2018/3/12/2275126.aspx

[3/24/18, 2:10:02 PM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): Like Hinduism. There is no one supreme God or Messiah.
[3/24/18, 2:10:33 PM] JB Jagdish Bajaj: 😀
[3/24/18, 2:10:45 PM] Sachit Jain: Nope
[3/24/18, 2:11:01 PM] Ranjit Gokarn (goki): If minor differences are taken into acct everything is a separate religion.
[3/24/18, 2:11:13 PM] Sachit Jain: And I don’t support minority status for this religion
[3/24/18, 2:12:15 PM] Nikesh: Kavi, could you roll this discussion from like 100 messages ago to now as my entry for #wtf please
