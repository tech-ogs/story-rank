  "comment": "Alok Gupta: Earlier say 30 years ago, when you would put your hand in the water while an immersion rod was heating it, you would likely get a shock. <br>Now you don't. Therefore it is clear that some body is taking  the bijli from the pani. I think there is a foreign  hand involved Alok Gupta: Also because there is no bijli in the Pani,it is not attracting the clouds. Therefore raining less.
