  "title": "China Is Selling Our Beloved Bhaturas As 'Scallion Bubble Pancakes' And We Cant Even!",
  "excerpt": "When China tried to copy our very own baby, the heart of north India and the staple food of everyone living in Delhi 'Bhatura' and called it 'Scallion Bubble Pancake,' Indians weren't impressed. Popular Facebook food page Tastemade shared a video (which they have taken down following the outrage) wherein they showed a brand new dish called Bubble Pancake. This bubble pancake is to be served with a savoury curry.",
