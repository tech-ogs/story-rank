  "title": "Living in polluted areas leads to unethical behaviour, cheating: Study",
  "excerpt": "Exposure to air pollution, even imaginative, may lead to unethical behaviour such as crime and cheating, according to a study conducted on adults in India and the US ... Since they could not randomly assign participants to physically experience different levels of air pollution, the researchers manipulated whether participants imagined experiencing air pollution. In one experiment, 256 participants saw a photo featuring either a polluted scene or a clean scene. They imagined living in that location and reflected on how they would feel as they walked around and breathed the air.",

  "comment": "Since they could not randomly assign participants to physically experience different levels of air pollution, the researchers manipulated whether participants imagined experiencing air pollution. <br> In one experiment, 256 participants saw a photo featuring either a polluted scene or a clean scene. They imagined living in that location and reflected on how they would feel as they walked around and breathed the air. <br> On a supposedly unrelated task, they saw a set of cue words (eg sore, shoulder, sweat) and had to identify another word that was linked with each of the cue words (eg cold); each correct answer earned them USD 0.50. <br> Due to a supposed computer glitch, the correct answer popped up if the participants hovered their mouse over the answer box, which the researchers asked them not to do. <br>  Unbeknownst to the participants, the researchers recorded how many times the participants peeked at the answer. <br> The results showed that participants who thought about living in a polluted area cheated more often than did those who thought about living in a clean area. WTF!?"
