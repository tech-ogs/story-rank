  "excerpt": "Dushaun Henderson-Spruce reportedly submitted a U.S. Postal Service change of address form on Oct. 26, 2017 for the UPS corporation, according to court documents. He requested changing a corporation's mailing address from an address in Atlanta to the address of his apartment on Chicago's North Side. The post office duly updated the address, and Henderson-Spruce allegedly began receiving the company's mail â€” including checks. Prosecutors say he deposited some $58,000 in checks improperly forwarded to his address.",
