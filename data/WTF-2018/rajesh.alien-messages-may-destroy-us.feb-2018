  "title": "INTERSTELLAR COMMUNICATION. IX. MESSAGE DECONTAMINATION IS IMPOSSIBLE",
  "excerpt": "A complex message from space may require the use of computers to display, analyze and understand. Such a message cannot be decontaminated with certainty, and technical risks remain which can pose an existential threat. Complex messages would need to be destroyed in the risk averse case.",

  "comment": "Mr Michael Hippke of Sonneberg Observatory, and Mr John G Learned of Deptt of Physics and Astronomy, University of Hawaii, are apparently serious about this.  <br> The paper is an interesting read : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02180.pdf  but the reader quickly figures out the validity of their approach once the following sentence is encountered : \"There are several possible threats from an ETI mes-sage. On the most basic level, a message might repre-sent a statement like “We will make your sun go super-nova tomorrow”. True or not, it could cause wide-spread panic. \" <br> Basically the defense establishment needs to be worried about aliens saying \"Boo\" loudly! <br> They do get into scenarios of messages being viruses targeting all the computers of the world, but omit the most obvious issue : the human body itself is vulnerable to viruses ... Why send a fxxxing message if you are so evil, just send a bloody bio-virus. <br> The WTF-ness of this paper becomes crystal clear in its concluding paragraph : <br> \"It is always wise to understand the risks and chances beforehand, and make a conscious choice for, or against it, rather than blindly following a random path. Overall, we believe that the risk is very small (but not zero), and the potential benefit very large, so that we strongly encourage to read an incoming message.\"<br> gee thanks captains of the obvious, our research dollars are indeed hard at work!"
