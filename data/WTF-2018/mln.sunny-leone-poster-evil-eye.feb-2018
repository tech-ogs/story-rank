  "excerpt": "Sunny Leone strikes a sultry pose in a red bikini against the green backdrop of a farmer’s large field of vegetable crop in Andhra Pradesh’s Nellore district. And as intended, she attracts all the attention ... The strategy is working apparently and Leone is diverting people’s gaze from his field. \"The trick has worked.
